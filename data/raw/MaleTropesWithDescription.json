They kick ass, take names, and can fend off armies single-handedly.\nThey can be the strongest character in the entire story. The reason for this is obvious: \"Experience and treachery will beat youth and enthusiasm every time.\" Old men in a dangerous line of work have been doing it for a very long time, and only lived that long because they've been smarter and/or stronger than everyone they've faced. Additionally, in a Crapsack World, or when Earth Is a Battlefield, a man may well only live to be old if he is already very bad-ass to start with.\nThe defining characteristic of the Badass Grandpa is that, as the story begins, they already have several or max levels in Badass, and will almost always have more than anyone else, including, in many cases, the Big Bad; yet they generally opt for quiet and simple lives, sharing their wisdom with younger generations rather than directly involving themselves. After all, every generation of heroes has to grow up and fight on their own sometime, right?\nBadass Grandpas hide their power level well...at least until it really matters. When the chips are down, and the heros look like they're in need of assistance, it's time for the Badass Grandpa to step up and throw down, proving that age has done nothing to quell their ability to take down villains literally decades their juniors.\nIf he's not The Hero then there will be a reason why he can't do the hero's job for them:\n He's not The Chosen One\n Helping Would Be Kill Stealing\n This Is Something He's Got to Do Himself\n Take Up My Sword\n etc.\nA Bad Ass Grandpa may be The Patriarch of a Badass Family.\nSee also Retired Badass.

A mentor to the officers under him, he takes a deep personal interest in their welfare and tries to keep them out of harm's way. He would never say, \"We Have Reserves\" (unless it would save more lives in the long run- but expect him to be torn up about it, though he may hide it almost perfectly\u2014and certainly never to make him look better). Staff officers, engineers, and the Camp Cook will be treated with respect and made to feel as valued as the troops on the front line, though he'll not put up with bureaucratic nonsense. He will never lay claim to work actually performed by his subordinates, and will try to pass the credit to where it's due if it is misattributed to him. He will accept responsibility for any mistakes, even if it was not entirely his fault, especially if the failure would result in severe punishment for a subordinate. He often follows up by treating his subordinate's mistakes as Career Building Blunders. And when his subordinates actually die, he will make sure to remember all of their names and faces.\nUsually a military mastermind who disdain wave attack carnages and instead will plan so that his faction will have the least casualties possible.\nStrategic or tactical blunders are usually the fault of those above him or below him. His career is often handicapped or cut tragically short by the incompetent High Command, his true worth appreciated only by the men he commanded. Or at least, that's the impression he projects to the troops.\nThis character generally cultivates a father-figure atmosphere. He is a source of morale, discipline and stability. Usually this is through a gentle reasoning tone, but sometimes he's a more strict (read harsh) father figure. In this instance expect a new soldier transferred to the unit to hate him, and for one of the older veterans to take him aside and tell a nice Pet the Dog story about the commanding officer. Sometimes all his soldiers are new; this will result in hatred until the soldiers either survive something that could have killed them, or accomplish a difficult objective, and realize that they would have died or failed without his strict training.\nHe is often utilized more as a device after he has left the scene, as an idealized counterbalance to the incompetent who succeeds him. This is probably because he's far more effective as a saint, and it'd be hard to maintain such an image when he's actually coordinating operations, especially cursed with Hollywood Tactics like he is. Indeed, an officer who learns You Are in Command Now may find his troops are Losing the Team Spirit over this commander's death\u2014though he can issue a Rousing Speech reminding them that the dead commander would be So Proud of You if they soldier on.\nSometimes he's used to make the troops unhappy with their new commander, even if he is a good one- similar to the \"You're Not My Mother\" response given even to kind substitute authority figures.\nOther times he's a character who gets called in to deliver an Aesop after the soldiers mess up. Or he might be a mostly off screen character who gives the main characters a reason to try and do better, and to be embarrassed when they make a stupid mistake.\nWhen an enemy, he is often the Worthy Opponent or Friendly Enemy. If he's a subordinate, the Big Bad's lack of concern for his men may be a source of Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal.\nDespite the title and the use of a male pronoun, this trope is sometimes Gender Flipped.\nMost of the movie and TV examples in The Captain are of this type.\nSister Trope to Officer and a Gentleman, and they may overlap. If he is a Blue Blood, he will not care that his soldiers are commoners. This often surprises other Blue Blood officers.\nRelated to The Last DJ, Benevolent Boss.

Deviations up or down will always be coupled with a lack of effectiveness. The Cool Old Guy is an exception to this. At some point, if one character is much older he swings the meter back to 'totally awesome'. In a lot of anime and video games, this makes him somewhere around middle age and the only non-clean shaven guy. Expect him to be greying, a loud voice, but in peak physical condition and unafraid of anything. For reasons that should be clear enough, this trope frequently overlaps with Bald of Awesome.\nHe usually won't have any special powers but that's only to marginally keep him from intruding on the others' limelight. He usually either has a dated and dramatic but lovable personality or is a complete no-nonsense hardass, depending on how the other characters act.\nIn Japan, this trope is called the Oyaji, written 親父 or オヤジ, which means \"daddy\". Can often stray into Even the Guys Want Him or Stupid Sexy Flanders territory. Wise Beyond Their Years is a younger version (usually no younger than late 20s at minimum) that has many of the same characteristics.\nSee also: Old Master, Older Sidekick, Badass Grandpa, Eccentric Mentor, The Obi-Wan, Dirty Old Man, Evil Old Folks, Token Adult.

In short, he knows how to be a gentleman but he also knows how to be a Badass.\nJust because he enjoys La Bohème and can tell the difference between bottles of 1938 and 1941 Moët et Chandon from the taste sound of it being poured doesn't mean he won't beat you to death with them.

His biggest priority is the protection of his people, and, unlike the pampered Sheltered Aristocrat, fully understands the hardship of an unprivileged life. He is usually a good warrior, but doesn't like fighting.\nHe's often short of being an All-Loving Hero, but doesn't always live in the right Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism for it. If he doesn't, his disillusioned gallantry can be just as poignant.\nYou'd think he'd make a perfect leader for his people, of course, but fate is particularly skilled at screwing him over in some way or another. If he does reign he feels his responsibilities perhaps too keenly.\nHe might start out being the Rebel Prince or Sheltered Aristocrat. The Evil Prince is his opposite (and sometimes his brother).

Unlike other aristocrats, the Wise Prince must typically journey somewhere, which will hopefully culminate in the Rightful King Returns.

Invariably Lawful Good and honor bound. First appeared in the Chivalric Romance. Lately has a very high incidence of having a Bodyguard Crush and Rescue Romance.\nA cultural trope in Europe since medieval times, most good knights practice something called chivalry, Honor, and Self-Control and occasionally chastity. Prone to rescuing the Damsel in Distress, or delivering her from false accusations, often whilst bearing The Lady's Favour. The Knight in Shining Armor was a frequent victim of The Dulcinea Effect: medieval Chivalric Romances, indeed, portrayed knights who fell in love with a princesse lointaine merely on hearing her described, without even seeing her - though his love and heroism usually won her heart. Another occupational hazard is Chronic Hero Syndrome, Knights Errant being charged to Walk the Earth righting wrongs until a worthy quest shows up.\nOften invoked to describe a man who acts chivalrously toward women. The term may be used in more cynical works to indicate a Wide-Eyed Idealist. Even the Ur Example of the straight usage of trope, King Arthur, messed around with it a lot. The one-two punch of Disney and Dungeons & Dragons saw this trope's stock rise like crazy.\nThe \"shining\" originally referred to the way his armor and weapons were kept in good condition, as opposed to the rust that accumulated for less competent knights. Most knights will be depicted wearing plate, despite its appearing relatively late in the era of knights.\nAs knights were also humans like any other, they mostly weren't like this, although it would be extremely cynical and most certainly false to say that none of them were like this. It's best to describe it as an ideal to which most knights aspired, at least publicly. True, the average knight was more interested in pig farming than warfare, but the chivalric code defined them as a class.\nWhen Prince Charming is a Knight in Shining Armor he's the Warrior Prince. Prince Charmless, on the other hand would not be a knight by choice.\nSee Lord Error-Prone and Miles Gloriosus for common subversions/parodies and Knight in Sour Armor for what happens when the world fails to live up to their standards, but they keep on being good anyway. A knight who is shiny for one person in particular is The Champion. A knight that gets magical powers as a reward for this goodness is almost certainly The Paladin to boot.\nIf the Knight in Shining Armor wanders the land seeking evil to slay, then he's also a Knight Errant.\nAnimated Armor will appear as this, all the way to The Reveal.\nSubtrope to Ideal Hero.

For some reason, we often take being clean-shaven as an indicator of being strait-laced and, under more traditional morality, a good person, pure of spirit. In older, simpler days, a traditional hero would not even have five o'clock shadow, even if he's been on the run and well away from his shaving mirror for a week.\nConversely, a man with facial hair is less pure, at the very least a Darker and Edgier Anti-Hero \u2014 more often, he's an outright villain, and his chin is deliberately contrasted with the depilated chin of the hero.\nNote that this generally applies to small, well-groomed beards, especially goatees. Having a huge bushy beard turns one into a Nature Hero, sailor, grizzled old prospector or Boisterous Bruiser. Except, of course, for the beards recommended by certain religions that are in the public focus at the moment.\nThe characters who sport a Beard of Evil are usually either the Big Bad or a second-in-command. This may play into the fact that in both western and eastern culture, goatees are traditionally worn by members of the aristocracy, and Aristocrats Are Evil.\nThe Beard of Evil has a long history of being associated most closely with the Evil Twin or Evil Counterpart, and you probably already know why. It also scores extra evil points if combined with a shaven head. (Anybody with a bald head and a beard is pretty much guaranteed to be a card-carrying villain unless they are black or East Asian.

They'll take every advantage and are not above using dishonorable tactics and dirty tricks, but they'll cry and moan every time the tables are turned and someone uses the same tactics against them, asks for a volunteer or reminds them of that promise they made. Often full of vicious plans for anyone they dislike, as long as they aren't in need of that person's skills at the moment.\nThough the Dirty Coward may be a sociopath, they're certainly not heroic or  comedic. And if they're a bastard, they're certainly not magnificent. They're usually only marginally competent to start with, and even the cleverest of them tends to be short-sighted. Even when they know that breaking ranks will leave a hole in the defenses that will let the enemy in, leading to far more danger for him or her in the long term, they will generally run for it anyway (and get shot In the Back). Their allegiance almost always lies with whoever can cause them the most immediate harm, even if that threat isn't likely to last. They'll be happy to badmouth people to their faces when they can not immediately hurt them, only to attempt to curry favor when the roles reverse. Dirty Cowards are especially prone to suffering a Karmic Death, usually at the hands of whatever they were trying to run from.\nUsually a villain unless used comically, although they may sometimes be a certain type of civilian that gets in the way. When used as a villain, this is a cheap way to make the heroes look good in comparison, even if they're not everything they should be. Villainous Dirty Cowards tend to fall squarely into Neutral Evil, since they are first and foremost out for their own hides at the expense of others.\nIt's tough to make a main character into one of these without them coming off as more slimy and irritating than funny. Unlike most villains, the dirty coward doesn't even have finesse, which can make them extremely annoying. The dirty coward may or may not have a horrific past to explain their actions, but it doesn't usually redeem them, at least not in the minds of the audience. When their backstory doesn't seem all that convincing, but convinces The Hero, it can be seen as a major cop-out.\nThe best way to make this character tolerable is to make him or her at least clever. Some enlightened self-interest can occasionally be mixed in, although too much of any trait other than cravenness tends to change the character into something else.\nMay Level Grind in courage if they realize What Have I Done.\nThe Dirty Coward is pretty much Always Male, for the dubious reason that women aren't expected to be brave in the first place, and are allowed to sacrifice others to save themselves. Fridge Logic may lead to the Neutral Female coming off as a Distaff Counterpart to the Dirty Coward. As Action Girls become increasingly unremarkable, this may start to change in the near future.\nMay be the Miles Gloriosus, and even believe his own brags when out of danger. The Fearless Fool may invoke this to persuade his companions to act like idiots. The Bully is often a Dirty Coward, brave enough when tormenting those weaker than they are, but showing their true colors in the face of those equal to or stronger than they are. Not to be confused with the Combat Pragmatist, who may employ tactics that can be considered dirty and cowardly but does so out of cold calculation rather than fear. Contrast the Lovable Coward, who numbers among the good guys and has foibles portrayed far more sympathetically. The So-Called Coward is by definition mistaken for one of these; if they don't want to be, they'll say \"Nobody Calls Me Chicken.\" See also Opportunistic Bastard." }

If someone threatens his kids they will soon wish they'd never come within a mile of them. This is because fathers are expected to take care of their family and this naturally extends to keeping them safe. Such occasions serve as a way for a father to prove his worthiness. (See A Real Man Is a Killer). Expect his children to have a newfound respect for their father and for them to brag that My Dad Can Beat Up Your Dad. If their relationship was previously strained expect it to improve.\nOften Papa Wolf incidents serve as a way to reveal that a Non-Action Guy is really a Retired Badass or a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass. In contrast to an Overprotective Dad (who sometimes thinks he's this), a Papa Wolf is always portrayed heroically because the latter is defending their kids from genuine threats instead of imagined ones.\nA Team Dad may display a streak of this, but the Papa is more likely to be related to his children by blood or through formal adoption, and the children tend to be younger, which may be part of why the Papa Wolf is more oriented toward protecting them rather than training them to defend themselves. However even completely grown children can summon this response in the face of crisis because they are still his children no matter how old or strong they get.\nThis is the Spear Counterpart to Mama Bear. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, no force on earth can stop them.\nSubtrope of Beware the Nice Ones. See also A Father to His Men. Combining this with Disproportionate Retribution can lead to a Knight Templar Parent. If the guy is a teacher instead, he's a Badass Teacher. If the guy doing this is a sibling/cousin, you get Big Brother Instinct. Inversely, see Parents in Distress for the kids rescuing the dad. Evil characters can use this too; after all, Even Evil Has Loved Ones. A subtrope of the Papa Wolf is the Badass and Child Duo, where an adult male badass takes it upon himself to protect an orphaned, unrelated young child.\nRemember when adding examples that this is a male only trope. The female equivalent is \"Mama Bear\" so all Distaff Counterparts should be placed there. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, it's a Battle Couple. Parents in Distress is the inversion, when Papa needs to be bailed out by the kids." }

The more you hate him, the more you will learn! So he gives you Training from Hell, and often seems to revel in it. In a way, he's the military trainee's equivalent of a Mean Boss, but there's seldom any other type.\nThe only training method that Drill Sergeant Nasty knows is The Spartan Way. He yells. He carpet bombs your ears. He makes you scrub floors with toothbrushes. He will make you drop down and give him 20, 50, or whatever arbitrary number he comes up with. He is usually played by R. Lee Ermey (who actually was a Marine drill instructor for two years) or a gruff black man (see: Louis Gossett, Jr.).\nOn kids' TV, this same character is a gym teacher, coach, or other authority figure. Often a veteran drill instructor who has trouble hanging up the chevrons.\nThe episode will often imply that Drill Sergeant Nasty is right: that, abrasive though he may be, everything he does is for your own good and everyone will come out the better for it. Of course, in the film Full Metal Jacket, the original Drill Sergeant Nasty drives one of the recruits into a mental breakdown, an outcome that you almost never see in any other examples.\nHe will often address those under his command as \"maggots\" or \"ladies\", or any other insults he can think of to motivate the people under him. He may also dish out (often derogatory) nicknames.\nIn Britain, the popular image is of the Sergeant Major, who is usually much less abusive, but no less demanding, and may or may not be marching up and down the square. If a British work has Shown Their Work, this role may well be filled by the Provost Sergeant, who is in charge of base discipline, and who the drill sergeants send recruits to go and see for their punishment.\nIn something of an ironic twist, the popularity of this character has impacted real military training. Recruits often enter with at least a passing familiarity with the trope, and don't take it (or the instructor) seriously.\nThis often spills into works that depict normal life in the military, more often than not, a higher ranking officer or NCO will randomly scream at the low private and punish him with push-ups or a random exercise. This tactic is unrealistic as most of the US Armed Forces branches have banned this practice outside basic training and the Officer/NCO themselves would get a far worse punishment for having ordered the punishment. If nothing else, the fact that some DSN's have encountered friendly fire (both on the battlefield and off) means that pushing too hard may be counterproductive.\nA very specific example of The Neidermeyer that, unlike that trope, will seldom lead his men into actual combat, because his job is to train them, then send them on to their next assignment. Compare Sergeant Rock, the guy who leads them once Drill Sergeant Nasty is done training them.\nThe Drill Sergeant Nasty is one of the best examples of the Genghis Gambit. It instantly provides 40 people who have nothing in common with one unifying dream, namely the sergeant's slow, painful and embarrassing death.\nCompare Veteran Instructor.\n\nExamples" }

He wears tight (often leather) pants and a loose, blousy shirt that appears to be made for a much larger man, often with a bandana, scarf, or kerchief tied around his neck. These will all be in bright or pastel colors. Sometimes he will wear extremely noticeable jewelry. He will often speak with a lisp and is given to flouncing, prancing, and standing with one hand on his hip as the other is flapped around or held out in a limp-wristed gesture. There is nothing ambiguous about this gay.\nExtreme cases will include a near-opaque slang, referring to himself and his gay friends with female pronouns, and minor to complete transvestism. Insofar as he has a personality, it will often be vain and catty, or even cowardly. Even though (compared to heterosexual men) he will rarely be shown having sex, he talks about it every second of the day, and if he isn't, he will be talking about clothes, the latest celebrity breakdown, or (celebrities') puppies.\nThe stereotype still survives because for some fraction of the gay male population, this is in fact Truth in Television. As such, this fact is greatly exaggerated by media, and this trope is made out to be more prevalent than it actually is. This can result in Unfortunate Implications, as it can lead one to believe that all gay men are (uber-)effeminate and, say, like flowers.\nUnlike Straight Gay characters, Camp Gays usually show up on television as caricatures or one-off jokes (see Monty Python's Flying Circus for a few good examples) because they're still seen as Acceptable Targets, even among other gays.\nSome professions are Always Camp, but not necessarily gay. Someone who's like this but nonetheless insists that he's not actually gay may be occupying a Transparent Closet, or he may actually be a Camp Straight.\nIt has been suggested that the ultimate ancestor of the Camp Gay was Oscar Wilde, whose mannerisms combined with his very public visibility defined the \"obvious\" homosexual for the English-speaking world at the end of the 19th century. (One wonders what would have happened if the other prominent homosexual literary figure of the period \u2014 burly backwoodsman-styled Walt Whitman \u2014 had instead become the model for the stereotype.)\nThe Camp Gay can be seen as the Spear Counterpart to the Butch Lesbian stereotype (in embracing the conventional characteristics of the opposite sex). Contrast with Straight Gay. Compare to Macho Camp. Often overlaps with Queer People Are Funny. Can be seen as male-specific inversion of Trans Equals Gay (that is, being a gay man means you \"must\" want to really be a woman)." }

Thus, many films from the era of The Hays Code contain Camp Straight characters (who are sometimes proven straight by a Last Minute Hookup).\nSome shows purposely do this to insert a gay character (or increasingly to insert a ''stereotypical'' gay character) without annoying the Moral Guardians. This kind of character also has some Values Dissonance involved. In the past, this kind of behavior was associated with people like The Dandy, and it was a symptom of them being ladykillers. In newer works, this character is more often used for An Aesop about judging people by appearance.\nThe Distaff Counterpart is very rare: there are few female characters in fiction (although rather more women in real life) who look and act butch while actually being heterosexual.

They do have muscles on muscles, after all.\nThough the trope usually involves campy behavior, such characters are also often portrayed as being so overly manly that it becomes impossible to take seriously. These types tend to be prone to flexing and talking about how macho they are, all the while being a rather obvious gay stereotype.\nThis stereotype is somewhat more common in East Asian cultures (where it has become the default gay stereotype, as fashion-conscious pretty boys are more associated with heterosexuals there) than in the US, but is still seen in Western media (Ric Flair being a well-know example. Almost always Played for Laughs, such characters are often introduced to be Plucky Comic Relief, or to hit on the straight guy who can do little to stop it.\nWhile it's possible to be camp but not gay, combining this trope with Camp Straight is difficult to do in a way that doesn't just look like a straightforward case of Testosterone Poisoning or perhaps Real Men Wear Pink.

A common variant is to have two male characters that are at the opposite ends of masculinity.\nOne guy will be your everyday Macho Man. He's rough, aggressive, and strong (or at least that's how he sees himself). He loves sports, cars, power tools, and general physical activity. The other guy in contrast will be much \"softer\". He loves poetry, literature, art, and is generally more In Touch with His Feminine Side.\nOccasionally these personality traits extend to their looks. The Macho Man will be tall and well-muscled. The Sensitive Guy will be slender. Anime usually gives him a bishounen look while Western production might go for a more nerdy one. If the characters are attractive, the manly guy will often be a Hunk, and the sensitive one will often be a Pretty Boy.\nThey may have an Odd Friendship or will be Those Two Guys in an ensemble cast. More frequently they are rivals or even enemies, especially in schoolyard settings. This is because the Manly Man may see the Sensitive Guy as a \"wuss\" for not displaying stereotypical masculine behavior. Similarly, the Sensitive Guy may resent the Manly Man for perpetuating those stereotypes in the first place. This is very apparent if the two are caught in a Love Triangle as the female will theoretically choose which of them she sees fulfilling the role of \"man\" best.\nThese two tend to get into a lot of Ho Yay or Foe Yay which drives a certain group of fans wild. If they're an actual romantic couple, they'll get Uke and Seme comparisons too. Related to Red Oni, Blue Oni with the Manly Man almost always Red and the Sensitive Guy almost always Blue. Also related to Power Trio with the Manly Man usually the id and the Sensitive Guy usually the superego.\nThe Spear Counterpart to Tomboy and Girly Girl. Similar to it, this trope can run the risk of Unfortunate Implications / Family Unfriendly Aesops if done wrong. Sitcoms are especially guilty of this as the main character often will be a Manly Man and if he's given a Sensitive Guy friend or neighbor as a foil, many jokes will be made at the latter's expense if he commits the grievous sin of being into opera instead of sports. On the other hand, the Manly Man can often be portrayed as boorish, mean and stupid if he prefers hiking and hunting to sewing.\nThis is a relative not an absolute contrast. The \"sensitive guy\" need not be a Dirty Coward, nor need the \"manly man\" be a Jerkass. On a Badass Crew, to some degree everyone will be a \"manly man\". As you want the characters to be likable, you do want most of them to have some characteristics of a \"sensitive guy\". And so on. The point of the trope is in the contrast between the pair. Often also used as a way to indicate that works relying on Mars and Venus Gender Contrast still have room for at least more than one stereotype per gender.\nExpect the Action Hero to be a Manly Man and the Action Survivor to be a Sensitive Guy in an Action Duo. Compare Sibling Yin-Yang and Red Oni, Blue Oni. When the Manly Man happens to be a woman it is a case of Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy. Contrast Emotional Bruiser where they combine. Compare with Noble Male, Roguish Male, where the Noble Male is still considered to be \"manly\" in a chivalrous fashion.\nImportant Note: While this is usually a straightforward trope, examples can still get subjective in regards to whether or not one of the guys is sensitive enough, the other is manly enough, or whether they're different enough. Keep a few points in mind when editing.\n 1. The two guys do not have to be physically stronger or weaker than the other to fit this trope.\n 2. This trope applies to personalities as much as physical strength or appearance. Two guys can be strong and if one acts sensitive and the other acts manly, then they fit.\n 3. The sensitive guy does not have to possess more feminine traits than masculine traits.\n 4. When you post an example be sure to explain how one is a sensitive guy and how the other is a manly man." }

Their love interests, if any, are left behind or bumped off by the bad guys.\n Sometimes, they are The Stoic, almost to the point of being less a character and more a physical incarnation of justice. They are very prone to having a Mysterious Past. This type generally overlaps with The Drifter.\n The classic Knight Errant of Chivalric Romance is often accompanied by his Distaff Counterpart and complement the Damsel Errant. He is seeking adventure and she knows where adventures are to be found.\nThere are many variations on the Knight Errant outside of Knights In Shining Armor. The Western very often stars a Knight Errant in the form of a wandering gunslinger or cowboy. Samurai are often, and Ronin are almost always, Knights Errant. Wuxia heroes are Knights Errant. Because of the shared archetype, stories about one type of Knight Errant can easily be Recycled IN SPACE \u2014 New Old West and Space Western are examples of this.\nCompare The Drifter, an accidental Knight Errant.\nSee Knights Errant for the webcomic." }

This is purely a fantasy of a strong, very desirable, dominant male who has (or wants) complete control over his partner, especially sexually, and the domination and emotional abuse is intended to be sexy (and often an expression of romantic feelings). Thus, if you are a good-looking male character who wears glasses, some fans will turn you into this, regardless of your personality.\nThe character type requires that the character be a possible Love Interest; if there's no hope that the opposite party will ever reciprocate, he's probably just a Stalker with a Crush or a Jerkass.\nA Bespectacled Bastard Boyfriend typically has a cool, sophisticated, or commanding way of speaking, an evil little smile, and an expensive suit. They are popular in media directed at a female audience.\nThe parent trope is Bastard Boyfriend (the \"kichiku\" part of kichiku megane).

Regardless of what happened \u2014 and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened \u2014 Mom seems to have raised her children on her own, or with the help of a father substitute.\nThere's a bit of a Double Standard in fiction regarding single parents. A Disappeared Dad is far less likely to have his absence explained than a Missing Mom. When he's not in the picture, it's often taken for granted that he's either dead or a deadbeat, or even worse. But if he is alive, he is more likely to either return and reconcile, or be a non-entity who sporadically appears just to remind the hero that Daddy doesn't care about them. It is also possible for the Disappeared Dad to have not ever met the child at all or even know that they exist, unlike the Missing Mom, since fathers don't actually have to be present during childbirth. Sometimes, a Disappeared Dad is not aware of being one; when that type of Disappeared Dad is actually an established character, you get Luke, You Are My Father.\nHowever, the flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all.\nHappens most frequently in animated series, but other media are not immune.\nCompare and contrast this with Missing Mom.

He is usually tall, slender with almost no fat, little to no muscle, and no body or facial hair. Large, expressive eyes are almost a given, though Tsurime Eyes are also common in more serious examples. In anime, many bishōnen have female voice actors, although those that don't get startlingly deep, sexy voices instead. It is not uncommon for those at the more feminine end to be mistaken for women by other characters, or for savvier examples of the type to take advantage of such an assumption.\nBishōnen can be found equally distributed between heroes and villains; bishōnen villains often develop devoted followings among fans. Bishōnen with white hair are almost always villains, no matter how they initially seem.\nThe psychology behind the concept is rather interesting. The aesthetic has a tendency to be standard of beauty that transcends the boundaries of both sexual orientation and gender. Why it appeals to females is disputed, but one theory is that a feminine man is less inherently threatening to female eyes, even if looks can sometimes be decieving.\nIn the English fandom, the term bishōnen simply connotes \"a really, really attractive male\", but in its original usage, it refers to a specific type of attractiveness that is found in adolescents. The cutoff for bishōnen in the strict sense is around 20 years old. Beyond this age, the Japanese describe male attractiveness through terms like biseinen or bidanshi (\"beautiful man\") or ikemen (roughly \"good-looking guy\"). The affectionate English fandom shorthand \"bishie\" bypasses the lexical issues somewhat. Examples of both Bishounen and Biseinen should be placed on this page. Likely to have drawn on a moe aesthetic when they were younger.\nThe comparable Korean concept is kkot-minam (\"flower pretty boy\"). The most similar Western type is Pretty Boy.\nThe appearance and behavior of the archetypal bishōnen is often used to explore sexuality and gender norms. Thus, Yaoi Guys have a tendency to be this.\nOriginally, bishōnen characters were the province of shoujo and Boys Love Genres, but since the mid-90s, it has become the default style for teenage boys in pretty much any work looking for a cross-demographic audience. Since more modern anime and manga are overwhelming geared towards appealing to both men and women in this respect, a large majority of virtually all mainstream works will feature at least one bishōnen character, if not more. Also the farther bishōnen characters disseminate from their source genres, the less likely it becomes that there will be in-universe mention of their androgynous looks/attractiveness.\nOlder Than Print, since The Tale of Genji has it in spades.\nOften comes with the Bishie Sparkle. If all the guys are bishōnen without many women to balance them out, you've got yourself a Cast Full of Pretty Boys.\nRelated to Rule of Glamorous. The Long-Haired Pretty Boy is a standard bishōnen design.\nContrast Gonk, Hunk, The Grotesque, and Puni Plush. Pretty girls are known as Bishoujo (\"beautiful girl\"), but the esthetics of bishoujo are different, typically emphasizing cute, petite femininity rather than sleek androgyny. See Bifauxnen for ladies who conform a bit more closely to the bishōnen aesthetic." }

In earlier works a character's outright fear of women was treated as a running gag. Dramatic protagonists who don't like women usually don't like other men that much more.

After all, there's nothing manlier than beating up a sissy. It doesn't even matter that the limp-wristed villain is powerful, he looks weak and homosexual and that's what matters.\nThe Sissy Villain is probably the second most common portrayal of Camp Gay men (besides \"one-dimensional joke character\"), but is not necessarily synonymous with Depraved Homosexual. While Sissy Villains are frequently gay or bisexual, most of them are merely sexually ambiguous or seemingly asexual, and some of them are straight. The Sissy Villain isn't intended to creep out the audience just because of the implication that he might like men (although this usually factors in), but because he acts like a \"pansy.\"\nThere is a weird bit of irony to this, regardless of what the villain looks or acts like, Evil Is Cool, and these villains will wreak just as much havoc as any other archetype. So, overexposure to this trope may lead kids to see this personality as Bad Ass in its own way, even leading boys to imitate their behaviour and mannerisms.\nNeedless to say, this trope has often been criticized for its Unfortunate Implications. It is also particularly amusing to see this trope used with villains who are also shown as trying to steal the girl from hero, though this might be a reflection of one of the tragic modes of the 'eugenics dramas' of Sol III: 'Unsuitable male breeds with desirable female'.\nThis trope shows up mainly in Western works and those Japanese works aimed at a male audience; if the villain is presented as certain kinds of swishy, female fans are likely to declare him utterly fabulous.\nSissy Villains show up frequently in anime, where they often have white hair. A common subtrope of the Sissy Villain is the Creepy Crossdresser. See also Fashion-Victim Villain, Gorgeous George, Depraved Homosexual, Depraved Bisexual, and Psycho Lesbian. May sometimes overlap with misogynistic views in the context of the Effeminate Misogynistic Guy. Contrast with Real Men Wear Pink, and occasionally, Evil Sounds Deep. When his ambiguous (nor not so ambiguous) sexuality is played for laughs, that's Queer People Are Funny. Not to be confused with Non-Action Big Bad, although they can overlap.\nNote: An Agent Peacock is considered Badass, even though you wouldn't expect it at first. A Sissy Villain emphasizes his viciousness through feminine behaviour. Both tropes can overlap, especially when Agent Peacock is evil.\nSince quite a few women actually find effeminate men attractive, this can also lead to Evil Is Sexy." }

Yep, nothing could possibly go wrong!\nIn what is possibly the mother of Dark And Troubled Pasts, this guynote (and yes, the character is pretty much Always Male) will have his wife and children die. This may be because the author wants to go for broke in creating a hero with \"nothing and no one to live for\". After all, the lack of emotional attachments holding him back and the burning drive for revenge makes for a singularly terrifying protagonist. When a family member does survive, it's usually a child rather than the wife, since a child is someone that has to be protected and couldn't stop daddy from making a whole mess of people into a holey mess. Or better yet, the child is someone daddy can mold into a weapon of vengeance. Of course, he might abandon the child to be raised by someone else, or do the revenging in secret. If the spouse survives, they will very likely have divorced rather than teamed up to seek revenge.\nThe causes behind the death vary: his family may be murdered by an enemy while he was Forced to Watch, die because of a mistake he made, or through some random act of human violence. In rare cases, they die in a horrible but (mostly) blameless accident. The \"mostly\" comes from the fact that he will somehow find a way to blame himself for their death in a form of Survivors Guilt, or better yet, blame God.\nOn the upside, this senseless and painful tragedy is a great personal motivator. The Crusading Widower will earn the \"crusading\" part of his name by hunting down and killing (at best apprehending) those responsible, however tangentially. Or he will try to drown his sorrows, only to be \"rescued\" by a friend who will motivate him with an offer to somehow atone or catch the culprits.\nIf it's a fantasy or sci-fi setting, a third goal may present itself: bringing them back to life. This is rarely a good thing. His loved ones will probably beg him not to, or he will choose not to resurrect them as part of a Friend or Idol Decision. Alternately, he may contemplate suicide or ascending to a higher plane of existence in order to rejoin them, though they will likely convince him to wait.\nFor obvious reasons, this character is usually on the low end of the Idealism/Cynicism scale, tending towards Anti-Hero, Anti-Villain, or outright Villain.

Cary Grant used to play this type of character frequently.\nHe steals for the challenge/pleasure of the job and generally avoids violence while restricting his targets to those who can afford the loss. More importantly for plots, the character will often go out of their way to stop more serious crimes - especially with lives at stake - either on their own or with the help of the police. As such they often adhere to Thou Shalt Not Kill and/or are Technical Pacifists. Murdering your target or stealing from them at gun point is not very gentlemanly. It's not uncommon for the GT to give at least a part of the goods he steals to the poor, often while very cynically commenting on social injustice and how the rich surely got their wealth with dirty methods, so it's only fair to steal from them and then give to those who need it.\nLike the Classy Cat-Burglar, the Gentleman Thief usually regards the police with a certain amount of disdain and condescension, and frequently leaves behind \"calling cards\" announcing who performed the crime; especially confident versions may announce their targets in advance to ensure a challenge. With a Worthy Opponent such as a Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist chasing him, they may have a less adversarial relationship, verging at times on friendship such as leaving Big Bad crooks behind for him to take the credit arresting (and when the opponent is of the opposite gender, fraught with UST of the Dating Catwoman variety). They're usually a Badass in a Nice Suit, occasionally doing the Tuxedo and Martini look. As he may not enjoy actual risks, the Gentleman Thief may decide that gambling is beneath him and cheat instead. Expect him to do so with sophistication. If he does gamble, expect him to be almost supernaturally lucky, or a tournament-grade player without peers. In many cases, they steal because they can and for the thrill, not out of an actual monetary need (since they are often rich) \u2014 though it may be a way to stave off Rich Boredom. This is also why they will never give up thievery for simple gambling.\nThey do exist in Real Life, yet their most usual technique is not stealing per se, but more like conning the victim.\nSometimes overlaps with Phantom Thief or Karmic Thief. See also Scoundrel Code." }

While the decor of their Poster-Gallery Bedroom is subject to the tastes of the character, be sure there will be a computer to communicate with the outside world. It's always Played for Laughs as an acceptable lifestyle target. More importantly, the subject is Always Male. There is little stigma to a female character living at home, and in some cultures it might even be expected. This makes the trope a huge Double Standard against men as well (but see below).\nThe guys who are depicted in this condition usually fit into one of the following:\n Lazy and unwilling to earn a living for himself.\n Childish and requires everything to be done for him.\n Can't get any and hasn't moved out to start a family.\n Technically unable to earn a living for himself. (i.e. unable to get a job)\nThank goodness those don't sound like nerd stereotypes, or we could be in real trouble. This trope has become much, MUCH less stigmatizing in Real Life, however, where the economy has been sending more and more adults back to their parents' homes. And if this article is any indication, this trope could even become discredited at some point in the future.\nNote that living with one's parents is a stigma mainly in the USA and other Anglosphere countries, where working-age adults are expected to live on their own, so this trope shouldn't be applied to characters from cultures where this is the norm.\nFor a more serious treatment of this as a social problem, see Hikikomori.

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "Aristocrats Are Evil. Ambition Is Evil too. So what could be worse than ambitious royalty?\nEvil Prince Bob knows he's the stuff of which great kings are made. Unfortunately, while he is in line for the throne, there are a lot of lesser men in front of him. If only Prince Bob could...persuade them to get out of the way, then nothing would stand between him and the glorious reign he knows he is destined to have.\nUsually the Evil Prince is not high in the line of succession, and his scheming arises from the fact that he won't inherit under current circumstances. But sometimes he is the eldest son and heir, and his only reason for giving his father a push into immortality is that he's too impatient to wait.\nA common subtrope is to have the Evil Prince as the younger brother to the king, who tends to be his polar opposite. This usually means the king is too good-hearted to see his brother's true nature, with bad results for the children of the king once he is gone (Evil Princes tend to make Evil Uncles).\nFor some reason there are very few Evil Princesses. One explanation is that, perhaps because of the very strong influence of Fairy Tale (and Disney) heroines, princesses are good characters (though queens may be evil). Another explanation is that royal daughters are usually not in the line of succession and have nothing to gain by disposing of their rivals. The rare princess who does ascend to the throne in this way will invariably be an utter tyrant as a queen.\nThis trope is rooted in an underlying belief that certain persons are or are not meant to rule, particularly when the monarch is understood to hold the throne by the will of some higher power. King Bob, by circumventing the rightful sequence of succession, is an illegitimate ruler \u2014 he wasn't meant to have the throne \u2014 and thus he and his rule will be bad. The irony is that legitimate rulers are not automatically good: the firstborn son may be a Royal Brat; the King who believes he is descended from the gods may become a tyrant. On the other hand, the law of succession is a better system for determining the ruler than combat and/or murder \u2014 and a man who would literally kill for the throne is unlikely to rule with kindness.\nThis is at least Older Than Print, stretching back to Mordred and seen as recently as Stardust.\nSee also Aristocrats Are Evil, The Baroness, Evil Uncle, and Evil Chancellor. If an Evil Prince already has the throne and is trying to keep the rightful heirs off of it, see Regent for Life. Regardless of how thorough they are in killing off rivals, there's usually a Hidden Backup Prince with better credentials.\nContrast with Sheltered Aristocrat, The Wise Prince and Knight in Shining Armor.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next steps down are The Good Chancellor, Evil Chancellor, Standard Royal Court and Deadly Decadent Court. The next steps up are The Caligula, The Good King, God Save Us from the Queen!, The High Queen, She Is the King, and The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask." }

Alice doesn't seem too interested, so Bob keeps trying, hoping that she will change her mind.\nThis can play out in one of two ways:\n If Bob and Alice are strangers or distant acquaintances when he falls for her, after the first confession that was turned down, he will show his affection in more and more spectacular ways to prove his serious intentions. Sometimes, the people around them will expect that Bob will eventually get together with Alice. Once Bob's displays of affection convince Alice to change her mind about him and give him a chance, the two will be portrayed as a normal couple. This is frequently used by romantic comedies or other shows/movies where they want to keep the audience asking Will They or Won't They?\n If Bob and Alice are either long time friends, or strangers who just got into a Just Friends relationship, Bob will take a more low-key route. Bob will likely begin by saying that he has his hopes for a more serious relationship, and he hopes Alice will eventually feel the same. He's content to be Platonic Life Partners until that time comes. From here, he may remind her of his unrequited love every time he sees her, or he may never mention it again. Alice might refuse the Relationship Upgrade because she doesn't want to ruin this friendship, or else believe that Bob just has a schoolboy crush he'll get over. If Alice is in a relationship, Bob might try to accept it for Alice's sake. If Bob dates someone else in the interim, this may make Alice have a Green-Eyed Epiphany and create a Unrequited Love Switcheroo.\nIn traditional straight examples, as long as Bob is an honestly Nice Guy, or at least a decent guy, both of these two attitudes are usually expected to result in success. Due to the Rule of Romantic, Alice will always realize over time, that she really happens to love him back.\nIn some recent works, a more cynical, take on the trope might be used to point out some ways this type of thinking could backfire, resulting in a Deconstructed Character Archetype. Type 1 might irritate the object of their affection by treating them like a video game sidequest, where more gifts and displays of affection will equal more attraction. It can also have implications of a Stalker with a Crush situation, if Alice truly dislikes or fears Bob. And Type 2 might be portrayed either as a Manipulative Bastard, for whom the whole long-term friendship is just a means to an end, or tragically mistaken for not recognizing that Alice still only feels like they're Like Brother and Sister and reacts with extreme Squick to romantic gestures. And both Type 1 and Type 2 might be examined to show that Bob actually feels that he's Entitled to Have You and thinks that, since he's a \"nice guy\" who is interested in Alice, Alice is morally obligated to date him.\nThis recent shift to more harsh portrayals is in part due to the usual cycle of tropes and part to media trying to avert the the implications that Men Act, Women Are, and that a romantic resolution depends solely on the man's determination.\nGender Inverted variations often occur, typically with a natural-looking, down-to-earth woman who is determined to win over the male friend she secretly loves, hoping he will eventually learn to appreciate her wholesome charms (often contrasted to the flashier appeal of a high-maintenance, unworthy gold-digger). For example in the Harem Genre, girls often recognize each other as \"rivals\", and treat the whole situation as a race where the most determined girl \"wins\" the protagonist's heart. Also, more traditional romantic stories, written by either men or women, might give a woman the same behavior, suggesting that these writers (and their audiences) find something inherently romantic about that kind of dogged determination, even without the Unfortunate Implications of a gender's inherent domination.\nSee also Extraverted Nerd, Just Friends, I Want My Beloved to Be Happy, Nice Guy, and Romantic Runner-Up. This heavily relies on the Hard Work Fallacy.\nCompare with the less sympathetic Stalker with a Crush, Mad Love, and Abhorrent Admirer.\nContrast Cannot Spit It Out, where the person is incapable of expressing their romantic interest even once, let alone over and over again.\nPlease keep the Real Life examples limited to those that examine the Dogged Nice Guy as a trope.\n\nExamples" }

His rare literal Distaff Counterpart (known as the Jock Bitch) exists mostly as a curiosity, mostly because it would take an unusually tall girl to play the part (at least six feet or taller).\nLike the Alpha Bitch, despite his largely repellent personality the Jerk Jock is surprisingly popular, especially with the school's staff and most adults, and can get away with most anything. Chances are he's the only child of a wealthy family and usually has his parents wrapped around his finger. If he has siblings, one of them is usually a Nice Guy or a Nice Girl with whom he doesn't get along. Often the son of some important Corrupt Politician who will cover up for him everytime. But even then, most Jerk Jocks know there are certain lines not to cross if they don't want to get disowned. Needless to say, all of the above often lands him a 0% Approval Rating, but that's not something he cares about. Often in open conflict with the Lovable Jock or with the Big Man on Campus, who are usually too influential or physically strong for him to bully, especially if neither of them is willing to condone his behaviour.\nHowever, where the Alpha Bitch uses her wiles and sex-appeal to get what she wants, the Jerk Jock usually isn't very smart and is more likely to fall back on fear of violent reprisal instead. Usually, violence is not an option to deal with him, unless The Hero or somebody on their side is indeed physically stronger than him. Other than that, manipulating him to his doom often proves to be the more effective way to deal with him, since he's seldom bright enough to see through intrigues and the fear of public humiliation, loss of status or his parents discovering his ways is often sufficient to keep him at bay.\nUnlike the Alpha Bitch who almost always gets what's coming to her, the Jerk Jock is a frequent Karma Houdini in fiction. But if the heroes try to get revenge on him by alternative means, this will often result in an Anvilicious Family-Unfriendly Aesop about \"not stooping to his level\". If the hero does manage to take revenge, it will be glorious and extravagant to such a brutal degree that one wonders if the writers are working through issues from their own childhood. In other cases, when Karma eventually comes for him, we'll see the Jerk Jock all grown-up, probably either a Jaded Washout, dreaming about his glory days, or a failed corporate thug who ended up in jail.\nIn shows focusing entirely on school life, he'll be a primary antagonist; however, if the school environment is merely a setting and not the key focus he's more likely to be just a recurring nuisance for the characters to deal with, or a Villain of the Week. In shows dealing with the fantastic, he can often be found Mugging the Monster, or portrayed as stupid enough to bully someone even if he knows that they have powers that could reduce him to a smear on the wall.\nWhilst it's not as common to get a sympathetic side to the Jerk Jock as with the Alpha Bitch, you'll sometimes get a softer version who isn't evil so much as an arrogant, self-absorbed Jerk with a Heart of Gold who doesn't really know any better. This version is much more likely to end up petting the dog, and may reveal his sensitive side in an Enemy Mine. He may also mend his ways and join the hero's side. And even while still a villain, the Jerk Jock can garner sympathy if he's given a Freudian Excuse (with having a \"Well Done, Son\" Guy as a father or an outright abusive family being the most common).\nIn some cases, the Jerk Jock could even be seen as a subtle author expression of white guilt, and/or anti-Americanism. This is because examples of this trope are almost exclusively white and either American, British, or German, (even in multicultural environments) and usually also exemplify the worst forms of behaviour stereotypically associated with white colonialism, even if it is only towards members of the Jerk Jock's own ethnic group.\nSee Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up and Kids Are Cruel. Compare to, and sometimes may even overlap with, Big Man on Campus, who usually matches the Jerk Jock in popularity, but is less of an antagonistic force. Also compare Dumb Jock. Little relation to Violent Glaswegian. Very likely to be a Barbaric Bully.\nContrast with Lovable Jock, which is often deliberately done to show that not all jocks are like this." }

Maybe the big guy will clasp hands with the short guy and fling him around as though he was a weapon. Or the big guy will use the short guy as a projectile.\nNo matter what, they will fight in tandem. They will watch each other's back. There is something genuinely satisfying about watching the heroes take out a room full of bad guys by working together.\nCharacters who tend to do this are The Hero and The Lancer because they are foils to each other and so their fighting style complements the other.

But the fact remains that when you get right down to it, they're a scary black man. Not necessarily evil, just... scary.\nAuthors will often claim this is not actually done in a racist way (not intentionally, anyway), as most anybody who is so much larger than the other characters will usually be equally scary (unless they're also outgoing or jolly). However, perhaps because of a lack of very large Asians who aren't sumo or very large white people who aren't professional wrestlers in a cameo role, they are often black. (This is the same reason that a Huge Schoolgirl usually isn't mean, either.) However, American media depictions cannot escape the legacy of the Big Black Buck (as featured in such influential films as D. W. Griffith's pro-Klan propaganda film The Birth of a Nation), the savage (noble or not), or modern thug culture. Amongst other reasons, when much of the creating population and the consuming population is not of African descent, then the Black Guy becomes other, and as such, easier to position as an imposing, scary force.\nThe few black characters in anime are usually some variation on this.\nSee also Scary Minority Suspect. Often Crosses over with Gentle Giant, Genius Bruiser, Proud Warrior Race Guy, and Token Minority, as noted both above and in the examples below. Compare Angry Black Man.\nNote that the character doesn't necessarily have to be of African descent, just large, imposing, brown/dark-skinned, and have a tendency to make people wet themselves with a single glare.

Alternatively, the plot may hinge on characters not suspecting that a character is gay (ie. they're in the closet), or it may be so incidental to the plot that it's never actually mentioned on-screen. It's still used for cheap jokes, though.\nIn some cases \u2014 especially Soap Operas \u2014 this may be because of a Suddenly Sexuality switch for a previously heterosexual character.\nIn real life, the \"straight-acting\" behavior is sometimes criticized by members of the gay community, with some members accusing straight gays of being insecure and trying too hard to fit in with straights due to not fully accepting their homosexuality. Some people just object to the term itself, feeling that it improperly conflates masculinity with heterosexuality, implying that homosexuality is by default anti-masculine. The other side of this argument is that camp gays are putting on a false over-the-top persona (or turning existing campness it Up to Eleven) either to 'fit in' with other gays, or as an insecure reaction to a mostly straight world.\nAs a counterpoint to the above, the reason why some heterosexual people reportedly find this trope more appealing than the more Camp ones is not necessarily because of revulsion towards homosexual acts themselves. Straight gay are instead consider preferable, because the queens/flaming types are viewed as attention seekers, or predatory/megalomaniacal.\nOften involves a situation where, if the character didn't mention he was gay, the audience would never know it. Can become anvilicious depending on how long he goes on about how being gay doesn't define him, though this could also show the character's inner insecurities.\nArguably a Spear Counterpart to Lipstick Lesbian. Also compare Bi the Way, Armored Closet Gay, and Real Men Wear Pink. The Gayngster is a subset of Straight Gays who are also gangsters or criminals.

This combo has the added danger of the audience seeing him as The Chick, a role that can de-masculinize him (to male viewers) or just make him annoying (to all viewers).\nThe Non Action Guy seems much more likely to be played for comedy than the traditional female version of The Chick as while women are not expected to kick ass (and thus those that do are exceptional) men often are and so a Non Action Guy's lack of ability is written as something to laugh at.\nOften he'll either grow into a more action-oriented role, become ignored, or become the Butt Monkey as punishment for his failure at masculinity. A common, more acceptable practice is to put him on the Mission Control, where he can be of actual help without having to use any sort of action skill.\nThe preponderance of this can vary from fandom to fandom, though the fans might have a point depending on how the character's written.

He's lazy, gluttonous and has miscellaneous other glaring vices. His children may love him, but they often don't respect him. However, he is still a sympathetic character; the source of his charm is his complete love and loyalty to his family, even if the main way he shows it is by fixing problems he caused himself.\nHis family is made up of at least one child nearing or in their teenage years, and a wife (usually much prettier than Dad) who spends her time Parenting the Husband. If he has one or more teenage daughters, at least one will be a Bratty Teenage Daughter or a Daddy's Girl; whether they are or not, the dad will be an Overprotective Dad in regards to the girl(s).\nOften used as an enabler of several Double Standards. Sometimes, on the rare occasions that a mom does something dumb, she's cut more slack than she otherwise would be, since the Bumbling Dad is there to make her look better by comparison. On the other hand, if everyone just gets used to tolerating Dad's incompetence, they might still hold Mom to the standards of a competent adult - in fact, she may end up being held responsible for fixing his screw-ups. After all, somebody's got to be the grownup in a family, and you can't hold Dad accountable for not acting like one if he's just an idiot. The frustrating and stagnant sexual roles enforced by this trope are often pointed to by feminists as a sign of how sexism hurts men as well as women.\nThis trope is still mostly seen in sitcoms and cartoons, along with many commercials, especially ones aimed at kids. In anime, this type of character is taken more respectfully, since it usually consists of a goofier dad, more involved with his family than the stereotypical Salaryman. This is even more common when his children have no visible mother.\nThis is an example of how a Subverted Trope can end up becoming the norm. Back in the day, fathers were assumed to be wise and in charge, and the Bumbling Dad was something fresh and unusual.

This is possibly a case of truth in television as women seem to have an easier time trusting girly men, and thus girly men often use this as a tactic to get laid.\n On a related note some characters use their femininity to maintain an element of surprise.

This is due to the breaking down of female-on-male abuse and cougars (i.e. older women dating younger men), so it is Truth in Television in a way.\nIt's a somewhat Discredited Trope nowadays, or at least heading into Dead Horse Trope territory in anything British.\nAlso see: Meddling Parents.\n\nExamples" }

Sometimes they have an actual talent to help them get through the war, which unfortunately may be the reason they were drafted to begin with, but often it's just tough luck. While the notion of innocent childhood is a relatively modern adoption (thank the Victorians and their contemporaries), even the ancients still felt fairly queasy about the idea - and with good reason: warfare screws with kids heads, and they're rarely good for much else afterwards. Since the use of child soldiers forces the enemy to gun down children in self defense, it's a very strong contender for the most morally reprehensible war crime in existence. On a somewhat lighter side, there are also many stories, in fiction and real life, concerning boys (and girls) who lied about their ages in order to serve their countries.\nThis trope is great for an angsty backstory while at the same time excusing Improbable Age with prior experience. A staple of the shows which focus on violence but broadcast to kids, notably the more serious Mecha Shows. It's a good way to subvert Children Are Innocent, particularly if a kid creepily sees it as a game, but sometimes the loss of innocence is played for as much drama as can be.\nIn fiction, this also has the convenience of explaining why Persons Of Mass Destruction are obeying their weaker bosses and not actually running things, or at least not demanding wages and better job conditions. It doesn't occur to them; and even if they do rebel, they don't know how to do it properly.\nThis trope blends imperceptibly with New Meat. Since even legal adults can be teenagers, old soldiers in particular may regard them as no more than children. This trope is Truth in Television; many armies in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa have underaged troops. Furthermore, even Western countries such as Germany, Russia, and the United States have overlooked recruitment ages in major conflicts such as World War II. This was likely to happen before the late 20th century, because births were not as well documented and the recruiters took them at their word if they looked about the right age. Though it's frowned on by Western culture, there is a certain brutal logic to conscripting youth - everyone is under threat, so everyone fights. Sometimes the children are better off on the front lines than enduring what would happen to them if the enemy takes their village. As a more pragmatic and ethical solution, many countries that feature soldiers in the 16-19 age range often utilize them in noncombat or support roles, and/or continue to train them until they're older, resulting in far better psychological health, effectiveness of personnel, and morale overall.\nChild soldiers can be divided in two types: Those who actually fight and kill humans, and those who either don't because they fight a nonhuman entity (Strike Witches, Stellvia of the Universe) or avoid lethal means (Lyrical Nanoha). The former usually carry a heavy trauma, while the latter tend to avoid it.\nSome Super Soldiers probably started out early enough to be counted as this. The Tykebomb (of all varieties) is what happens when this trope backfires.\nCompare Little Miss Badass, Creepy Child, Cute Bruiser, Enfante Terrible, Kid Samurai, New Meat, Young Gun, Recruit Teenagers with Attitude. The Shell-Shocked Senior may actually be a high-school senior.\nContrast Falling into the Cockpit, which usually implies no former military experience. See Plucky Middie for the naval version. See also Raised by Orcs for cultures that use their enemies' children this way.\nIf only children get to be soldiers, then you have a Competence Zone on your hands. If it's because they're the only ones left, then you have a Teenage Wasteland on your hands.\nVery much a Truth in Television. This trope is almost always Always Male." }

Combining the Deadly Sins of Envy and Wrath, nothing pushes his Berserk Button faster than seeing someone else look at his Love Interest (or worse, his Love Interest look at someone else).\nNaturally, this is often handled differently than the Clingy Jealous Girl. An irrationally jealous female partner is often used as an element of comedy or treated as supposedly \"normal\" behavior for a woman, whereas the irrationally jealous male partner is more likely to be treated as if he has a serious flaw: it's portrayed less sympathetically, criticized more harshly by fans, less frequently played for comedy, and has a higher tendency to either rape the girl/guy he's in love with or Murder the Hypotenuse, rather than drag the object of their affections away by the ear or pummel them with a Hyperspace Mallet. Interestingly, though, at the far end of jealous insanity, the Yandere is far more often female.\nHowever, a guy obviously acting paranoid in a situation where there's no reason for him to be jealous, especially as a Running Gag, makes for comedic gold. As long as the comedy comes from making the guy look like a fool and not from making his partner suffer, it's okay.\nOf course, all bets are off when this trope is mixed with the Boys Love or Ho Yay, which is certainly not all that rare; in fact, the biggest Played for Laughs examples tend to come from this field.\nMay double as a Stalker with a Crush or Prince Charming Wannabe.\n\nExamples" }

However, the degree to which individual samurai actually adhered to bushido (which as a formal concept may be Newer Than They Think, according to historians) varied about as much as the degree to which individual knights in Europe adhered to the code of chivalry \u2014 which is to say, you could find everything from bandits in armor to saints of the battlefield. Although women could be and frequently were warriors, the social and military rules for them were somewhat different than for men (and the word samurai itself, being inherently linguistically masculine, was/is not technically used for females).\nA popular misconception holds that the samurai were the counter-culture to the ninja; that is, whereas samurai tend to came from the upper classes and were honorable warriors who fight face to face and use no \"dirty\" tricks, ninjas tend to be from the lower classes, were skilled at unorthodox warfare and would not hesitate to use backstabbing, poison, or spying to gain the upper hand. This is commonly seen in works featuring ninjas, in which samurai and ninja were either depicted as mortal enemies, or ninjas being mercenaries hired by the samurai to do the unsavory wetwork honorable samurai would not do. However, the aforementioned depiction is not historically accurate. In Real Life, while some ninjas were mercenaries, most ninjas were actually samurai themselves. The idea that the ninja were something separate from the rest of Japanese society came about during the Edo period (a 250 year long period of peace), after Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun and unified the country. Edo-period samurai started assuming the values of the court-aristocracy, while simultaneously resurrecting centuries-disused aspects of the samurai honor code from before the Mongol invasion, and didn't like to talk about actual warfare\u2014they also pretended they were primarily swordsmen, while the main role of the samurai was actually Horse Archers. Many modern historians believe the entire concept of ninjas being the counter-culture to the samurai was invented by Edo-period novelists to avoid showing recently gentrified samurai involved in anything remotely dishonorable.\nSubtypes of the samurai commonly seen in anime include the Kid Samurai and the Ronin, a samurai without a master to serve whose 'low class' status is sometimes designed to be more identifiable.\nOne thing you won't hear a lot about in samurai fiction is the practice of shudo, which means \"the way of the young.\" Shudo was a form of pederasty that was commonly practiced by the samurai class, and was considered a very high and noble form of love. The practice fell out of favor during the Meiji Restoration, and has often been the victim of omission and whitewashing in both fiction and historical accounts, though it occasionally crops up in the Boys Love Genre.\nSamurai are popular heroes in period stories, and no few anime feature them. Such heroes, naturally enough, tend to be paragons. Outright subversions tend to be for specific characters and even then usually criticizing the upper class as a whole. Samurai and their code of ethics were featured heavily in Japanese military propaganda during the early twentieth century. For obvious reasons, they are much less popular in certain Asian countries.\nWhen samurai are presented negatively, expect them to be wearing their full armor, including an elaborately designed and intimidating helmet. When they're being presented as paragons, expect them to at least be helmet-less, or sometimes wearing nothing but a Hakama. Speaking of samurai armor, it was usually made of leather-backed iron scales laced with silk, or later on, iron or steel lames riveted together. While it was often coated with lacquer to prevent moisture from rusting the metal, it was never made of wood like some sources claim.\nNot to be confused with the Cyber Punk \"Street Samurai\" character type. A more modern take is the Corporate Samurai, who takes the general ethos of the samurai and applies it to a modern setting. The Distaff Counterpart is Yamato Nadeshiko, a Japanese woman expected to be loyal, respectable and capable of fighting.\nSee also Jidai Geki. Japanese Spirit also incorporates a lot of old samurai tropes and virtues into modern manga.\n\nExamples" }

There's an additional Double Standard in that male examples are almost invariably played for comedy with the man being the butt of the joke: female examples either tend to attribute the character's lack of lubrication to her partner's sexual inadequacy or unattractiveness, or to deep-seated psychological issues or traumatic sexual experiences.\nNamed as a pun for a song note \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" that has absolutely nothing to do with impotence, but the Double Entendre is too good to pass up.\nContrast Raging Stiffie, Speed Sex (for when the guy goes off too quickly rather than not at all), Something Else Also Rises.

Her word is law, and he can only obey, with a meek and humble, \"Yes, dear.\" We laugh at his misfortune, and maybe pity him a little.\nFrequently, he will be a small figure, literally overshadowed by his behemoth of a wife. Bigger than he is, she nevertheless expects him to carry all her packages when out shopping, to run all her errands, and to care for whatever snarling pet she dotes on. All the while his own hobbies and sources of personal enjoyment will fall by the wayside (\"No, honey, you can't watch the game Sunday, we're going antiquing!\" \u2014 and he will).\nSome of these men are resigned to the horror of their lives; others try to escape, oftentimes to their regret. There are two possibilities if the Henpecked Husband actually succeeds in standing up to his wife: either she'll hold her ground, provoking him to divorce her and revel in the newfound freedom, or his wife will not only back down, but instantly swoon and throw herself at him \u2014 she was secretly yearning for him to grow a spine all along.\nA common feature in the Awful Wedded Life Dom Com genre. Originally, this trope was a subversion of expectations \u2014 a husband dominated by his wife was funny because it was the reverse of the normal, proper situation where the man was in charge of the household. After all, a real man could never be dominated by any mere woman, so the Henpecked Husband must be a wimp who deserves it. Today, the notion that the man must be the head of the family is mostly a Discredited Trope, but the idea that there's something inherently hilarious about a woman dominating a man still lingers. While cries of Henpecked Husband are sometimes raised at the slightest implication of a wife being in charge of anything, it's only very recently that it's started becoming common for the truly overpowering examples to be held up as abusive.\nIf it's a relationship where the two of them really love each other, this will be played even more for laughs, with the joke more likely to be not that the husband is suffering, but that he's delusional. Maybe the husband starts talking about how he \"wears the pants in the family\". The wife will then make a comment or suggestion, and he'll immediately cave. Yeah, he's whipped.\nCompare Momma's Boy and My Beloved Smother in the case the husband is replaced by his son. See also No Accounting for Taste.

A NEET is either between jobs and down on his luck, an idiot who has failed the entrance exams for college, or a Lazy Bum with no goals in life, freeloading off whoever is around. Occasionally the NEET might also be a shut-in, and unable to enter into society because of some debilitating agorophobia or peer pressure. Either way, he will probably have something like \"Shut up, you stupid NEET!\" or \"Get a job!\" yelled in his face at least once. Probably more than once.\nIn most stories featuring this Trope, the NEET is the world's Butt Monkey, or at least perceives himself as such. The Deadpan Snarker will take every opportunity to remind him that he's useless, while more sentimental characters may try to motivate him to get a life with a Rousing Speech.

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "A common Japanese character type, the Bastard Boyfriend (in Japanese, kichiku, literally \"brutal\" or \"demonic\") character is an Always Male Love Interest whose defining trait is that he is cold, cruel, or abusive to his romantic partner, in a manner intended to be kinky and appealing to the audience. Western versions exist, but are comparatively rare nowadays due to the inherent Unfortunate Implications, except in fanfiction (which lacks the watchful eyes of Moral Guardians).\nBastard Boyfriends can be readily distinguished from the more generic Jerkass or Domestic Abuser because their abuse is eroticized, and their beloved's conflict and unhappiness will be played for titillation. As such, they are all-but-guaranteed to be Mr. Fanservice, usually a Bishōnen, and the consequences of their behavior are almost never handled realistically. The Bastard Boyfriend almost always gets his girl (or guy), even in cases where they don't seem particularly compatible, although a few are doomed to merely be the rival.\nThis type is common in Yaoi Genre (as a standard Seme type), Shoujo, and, to a lesser extent, Josei romances, but comparatively rare in works aimed at a male audience, where guys like this are more likely to be the Romantic False Lead or just a villain.\nTheir love interest, male or female, is usually The Protagonist, although a minority of stories are from the Bastard Boyfriend's point of view. They will probably be presented as a Love Martyr or The Woobie, and is likely to spend quite a bit of the story anguishing over the relationship, possibly while weeping beautifully. This trope has next to no overlap with Belligerent Sexual Tension, since Bastard Boyfriends never seem to show an interest in anyone with the backbone to defy them.\nThe Bastard Boyfriend is sort of the Alpha Male equivalent of a Type A Tsundere, but with the violent temper replaced by cutting sarcasm and the deredere side turned down to near-zero. They are, of course, completely immune to Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest, but they're usually not physically abusive, since that's just not hot. There are plenty of exceptions, though.\nBastard Boyfriends come in two major types:\nUnconflicted (standard): Poised, confident, and perfectly happy with his own behavior, either because he doesn't care what the other party thinks of him, genuinely believes that abduction and molestation are viable ways of showing his affection, or just is a plain, sadistic bastard. The Bespectacled Bastard Boyfriend (Kichiku Megane) subtrope is built on this type.\nConflicted (less common): Troubled, but Cute, and his abusiveness is generally driven by jealousy, insecurity, a crushing inability to express his feelings, a Dark and Troubled Past that completely screwed up with his view of the world, or (very rarely) a desire to drive the other person away (possibly out of a belief that they will be happier with someone else). This type may have started as an attempt at a more realistic implementation of the character type.\nBoth kinds are highly likely to be jealous and possessive. Expect plots to feature a Green-Eyed Epiphany \u2014 a character realizing their love only via jealousy.\nThe Bastard Boyfriend is likely to be redeemed by The Power of Love at the end of the book; alternately, he may eventually be revealed to be nicer underneath. A minority may be revealed to have a Freudian Excuse (such as Abusive Parents or extremely bad former romances). If none of these things happen, his partner may decide that Stalking Is Love and embrace their status as a Love Martyr. Along the way, the Bastard Boyfriend may well be Master of the Mixed Message, if the author needs something to keep his partner strung along.\nMature-rated works that have Kichiku characters are likely to involve psychological abuse, Loving Force, and maybe some BDSM. PG-rated examples tend to be cold, aloof, or sarcastic. In either case, fan reaction tends to be polarized: either they're hot and sexy and their love affair is squeeable, or they're total Jerkasses and the relationship is squicktastic.\nWorks that contain Stalker with a Crush or Mad Love relationships are likely to attract fan interpretations where the characters are recast along these lines.\nSpear Counterpart of Bastard Girlfriend. Usually a type of Romanticized Abuse and subtrope to All Girls Want Bad Boys, with a side order of Evil Is Sexy. If the Kichiku character also has status, power, and hot little glasses, he's a kichiku megane (see Bespectacled Bastard Boyfriend). For sort-of Western equivalents, see Handsome Devil, who is usually more sarcastic than cruel, and the Romance Genre Heroes under The Bastard and The Sadist, although those are usually played as villains. Contrast the Jerkass varieties of Romantic False Lead and the Disposable Fiancé, who are superficially similar but guaranteed not to get the girl, and the Domestic Abuser and Unsexy Sadist, who have the cruelty minus the fetishization.\nA Handy Chart to determine if a character is this trope: Your guy is in love, and he demonstrates his love in an abusive or predatory manner. His love interest:\n Wants nothing to do with him: Stalker with a Crush\n Thinks his behavior is sooooo romantic: Stalking Is Love\n Abuses him right back: Belligerent Sexual Tension\n Is unhappy and conflicted, and:\n The author wants you to think he's a Jerkass and she's a saint for putting up with him: Domestic Abuser meets Love Martyr\n The author wants you to think he's totally hot and the relationship is deliciously kinky: This Trope." }

Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his conquests.\nDue to gender double standards, the Casanova is always male, given that women are usually shamed for having an active sex life. The comparatively rarer female version is traditionally called a \"man-eater\", but she\u2019ll likely be portrayed as an evil character who exploits her sexuality to manipulate innocent men. The womanizing skills of the Casanova, on the other hand, will almost always be granted to him to make him look like a champion. This trope also applies almost exclusively to straight men, given that queer people with an active sex life are usually villainized in media. Meanwhile, straight men get to be portrayed as badasses for having multiple women at their beck and call. On a further note, the Casanova is also usually white, since men of color are commonly depicted as perverts when they give in to their sexual desires.\nContrast with the unsuccessful Casanova Wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable Kavorka Man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, is a Chick Magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with Chivalrous Pervert. The Charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. A Handsome Lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Cassanova.\nThe trope is named for Giacomo Girolamo Casanova (1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Womennote \"Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it.\") established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a Chivalrous Pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages \u2014 and also gained his successes famously ugly. (Definitely◊ he was no Heath Ledger◊.) Interesting and prone to be noted for his modern wannabes, he was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners.\nMany films, TV movies and TV mini-series are named for and based on that person. The best known are Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger, and the 2005 BBC drama mini-series starring David Tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't.\nFor the juvenile version \u2014 all of the above without the sex \u2014 see KidAnova. Contrast the Serial Romeo. If the guy is actually only rumored to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the Urban Legend Love Life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a Ladykiller in Love. See More Friends, More Benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way.\nNote: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better." }

Therefore, because Most Writers Are Male, men in sex scenes will be far more covered than women, even during intercourse. The woman may be completely naked (or at least not wearing anything visible; a skintone patch or a cover between legs can be completely hidden from the camera in a way that a penis can't), but the guy will still have his shirt on \u2014 or sometimes only his fly is down. It doesn't matter that with his fly down and his belt off the guy's pants would fall down. It also ignores how painful sex with a metal zipper rubbing up against the genitals could be. All that matters is seeing that sweet, sweet fanservice with the least amount of squick. Selective Squick anyone?\nThis is most obviously shown by the trope where, even after sex \u2014 or sometimes even during sex, when it's interrupted \u2014 men will be shown wearing boxer shorts; apparently the message is that women also don't want to see a man's naked \"area\" \u2014 even while having sex with them. It's also done for practical reasons. Genitalia in general are too hard-core for anything less than X-rated sex scenes (but are fine for PG-13 otherwise), and it's simply impossible to avoid seeing men's genitals while showing their \"area\"; meanwhile women typically wear loose lingerie to avoid showing even pubic hair.\nFor an analysis of why creators may choose to use this trope, take a look at the Analysis page. (Tab above)\nCan be a case of Truth in Television. Couples engaged in public sex may wear as much clothing as possible for varying reasons.

Typically, you're in a Boy Band if you began recording while still in your teens; if you and your bandmates are all extremely pretty; if few, if any of you, play instruments; if your boss is a large and often intimidating man; if you can't get any respect from the Serious Music Critics; if you have a hard time crossing over to an adult audience; and especially if the girls can't get enough of you. Can generate a Periphery Hatedom when a boy band is popular enough.\nYou definitely were in a Boy Band if, years and years after the fact, your fandom looks back on your early albums as an embarrassing phase, Guilty Pleasure, So Bad, It's Good, or (if it's old enough) Camp. Songs from said groups often qualify as Silly Love Songs and as earworms, many of them trying to convey warm and fuzzy feelings (that sometimes goes too far).\nSome of the tropes and musical stylings typical to Boy Bands started with The Monkees and several other groups of the era. Technically they could be considered boybands as well, but when most people hear \"Boy Band\" they tend to think of the late-80's - late-90's bands listed below. For fans of 60s pop groups such as the Jackson 5 and The Beatles, mentioning that said groups presaged boy band marketing in terms of having a spinoff TV show, talking with teen magazines, having popular lunchboxes/T-shirts/stationary/etc, and the like sometimes triggers a Berserk Button reaction. The term \"boyband\" is generally reserved for groups which are assembled by a record company or other entity, whereas most bands form organically (although there are exceptions, in both directions).\nAt least one wag has suggested that the real original Boy Band was Alvin and the Chipmunks, both for the popularity among pre-teens and the squeaky music sound of both the real and cartoon bands.\nMost Boy Bands follow a particular Five-Man Band archetype, established by New Edition and New Kids on the Block, that differs from the traditional one used on this wiki. Whether or not they can actually sing matters little\u2014 that's what Auto-Tune is for\u2014 and don't get us started on whether or not they can actually play instruments. It is as follows:\n\n\n The Heartthrob / Sweet One: The unofficial Face of the Band, and the one who was put there to draw the Squee of millions of adoring teenage girls (at least, the most Squee). Most likely a former model. Is most likely to appear shirtless on the posters and in photo shoots. He is also the one most likely to have a successful solo career once the group disbands. If the band gets a movie, count on him to be the protagonist.\n The Bad Boy / Rebel: The one with a rougher edge to him. He's the one wearing the black shirt and jeans or leather jacket in those videos where they're not all wearing matching clothes. If he's really edgy, he may also have a tattoo. Put in to cater to those girls who want bad boys.\n The Cute One: A second heartthrob. Less sexually threatening than the Sweet One, and often meant as a foil to the Bad Boy.\n The Older Brother: A cool, reassuring figure that the girls can relate to.\n The Shy One: Nerdier than the rest of the band. He's cast because Nerds Are Sexy. May come off as wondering what the hell he's doing in the band in the first place.\nIn the examples below, you'll notice very few black R&B groups are included such as Jodeci or Blackstreetnote It's worth pointing out that they predate the Backstreet Boys by several years. But after the latter group's success, they started stylizing their name as \"BLACKstreet\"., despite having similar appeal. This is because they generally don't fit the mold of a boy band: they're more likely to form among themselves, less likely to follow the Five Man Band archetype as explained above, and are more likely to have rougher edges (Parental Advisory stickers are not unheard of), making them slightly more appealing to males.\nAlthough they are not very famous outside Asia, Japan has been creating boy bands since The Seventies. The most notable boy band factory is Johnny's Jimusho, which currently manages about fifteen boy bands. Today Johnny's bands dominate the charts, with SMAP and Arashi topping pretty much constantly. Dramas that famous boyband members star in pretty much always do well, and you will see members of popular boybands on TV variety shows quite a lot. The boyband machine is so well-oiled in Japan that many of the tropes applied in the West don't function - boybands have large adult followings (usually middle-aged women) and men seem to be able to handle it, if not love it - you WILL sing A-RA-SHI many times in karaoke in mixed company, just because everybody knows it.\nLately, Korea has been getting on the action too with bands like DBSK, 2PM, SHINee, B 2 ST, U-KISS, Super Junior, etc. This goes hand in and with the general k-pop explosion of the late 00s and the past few years.\nBoy bands are a major source of Real Person Fic (a subgenre called bandslash), where you basically have one of two types: Female OC woos band member, or the band members woo each other. In Japan the majority of RPF Doujinshi are bandslash.\nMost boy bands tend to last around five years before members are released from their contracts (or they simply expire) because something else has come along. Depending on the success of their subsequent individual projects, many re-form 15-30 years after their heyday to cash in on their now-nostalgic original fandom - this phase can last decades. Expect at least one Replacement Goldfish for a member who's become a successful solo artist/died young/has a non-entertainment career they don't want to walk away from for the time necessary to record an album and go on tour.\nThe Girl Group is the Distaff Counterpart. Oddly enough, girl groups notably preceded boy bands by years, examples being the wildly successful 60s artists The Crystals (of \"He's a Rebel\" and \"Then He Kissed Me\") and The Shangri-Las (of \"Leader of the Pack\" and \"Remember (Walkin' in the Sand)\")." }

They became the biker gangs of the 50s, and it sort of went from there.  The BDSM part sort of merged in later. In fact some of the older leathermen (the \"old guard\") have few if any S&M tendencies. Just a strict code of honor, obedience to tradition and hierarchy and a strict set of rules.\nA related but distinct group are bears, masculine types with body hair, heavy-set builds, and/or \"traditionally\" masculine behaviour.  Both groups formed in part because the gay community itself had developed certain stereotypical expectations - typically, hairless young \"metrosexuals\". Or drag queens.\nThe defining characteristic of both groups was a certain visibly identifiable look and behavior. Which, of course, meant that once TV got around to even acknowledging that there was a gay subculture, these two were mashed together as possibly the stereotype to portray, after \"classical\" gay archetypes.

He may have a Carpet of Virility, he may be a Badass, or he may have Stout Strength...but regardless of how he got here, the result is the same: While being gay, he's manlier than your average man, straight or Straight Gay.\nThis is a stereotype more associated with modern gay porn, but is also a certain distilled ideal of gay men that appeals more often to other gay men \u2014 one of the reasons it has become so associated with gay porn. Such characters also appear in other works as a means of telling a Gay Aesop about homosexuals not all being flaming queens.

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "In Real Life, white is usually the color for summer clothing, given the quality of the color that reflects all spectrums of visible light away and - as such - offers some relief from the merciless heat of the summer sun. It is not considered an ideal color for most other occasions, given how easy white cloth is to stain and how clothes that absorb heat are desirable in most other climates.\nOf course, in the world of fiction, concerns of practicality can be (and generally are) sacrificed for those of symbolism. The Man in White is a character who goes around dressed entirely (or predominantly) in white wherever he is. The reasons for this are not important, but what it signifies to the audience is; and it just so happens that in most cases, it signifies that the character is up to no good.\nThere's just something about a man in white that weirds people out. One possible explanation for this is that since conservative men's attire has been dark-colored for the longest time (black, charcoal, and navy), looking upon a man in white creates a sensation not unlike a color-inverted image. Another one is that since white is also the color of snow and bone, an all-white ensemble evokes sensations of coldness and death.\nIn the US, white suits have also come to be associated with Southern plantation owners, leading to the birth of the Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit. As such, white clothing in American media can also be used to suggest pride, avarice, ambition, and questionable morality, which is why you can see so many mafiosos, drug lords, and corrupt corporate executives in such garb. For a more in-depth treatise on the subject, see this article.\nAs such, it isn't surprising to find that most men in white in fiction are unnerving at best and eldritch abominations at worst.\nOf course, perhaps the reason it signifies that the character is up to no good is precisely because white is supposed to signify that a character is good, since that is the colour most associated - at least in the West - with an upstanding, honest, kind, or moral person; their clothing is as immaculate and pure as their soul. Having the Man in White be a villain turns this on its head and may evoke ideas of Most Definitely Not a Villain or Suspiciously Specific Denial. They pretend to be good either because they truly believe it or precisely because they are evil.\nOn occasion, the Man in White might actually be genuinely good (if uncannily otherworldly), as Morgan Freeman in the pic demonstrates. Sometimes, its just Exactly What It Says on the Tin and you have a genuinely nice person who literally wears his goody-two-shoes-ness on his sleeve. Tropes Are Not Bad, and the Man in White need not be either.\nOther times, the color white might simply come with the position: doctors and scientists have their pristine labcoats, priests and monks don long white robes, and some military officers get white dress uniforms\u2014or indeed service uniforms, in tropical postings (the Imperial British or French soldier/sailor in pure white and a pith helmet lording it over the natives is an iconic image of the 19th century). Since white clothing is expected of these characters, their appearance tends to impress (rather than unnerve) the audience and their fellow characters.\nCompared to its Distaff Counterpart, the Woman in White, the Man in White is a much younger trope and not nearly as well established; as such, you'll find a broad range of characters and characterizations under the examples. All it really takes to be a Man in White is to wear white: all the added symbolism described above is just bonus.\nNote that in Japan, men wear white tuxedos at their weddings because they think it looks Western (and it matches their bride's white wedding dress). The fact that Western grooms typically wear black is of no concern.\nThe chromatic counterpart of The Men in Black. For other uses of the color white, see Blood-Splattered Wedding Dress, White Shirt of Death, White Hair, Black Heart, Mystical White Hair, and the more explicit about significance Gold and White Are Divine." }

His father will be absent or just as browbeaten. On the other hand, if he does stand up to her then he's not a Momma's Boy, even though she's still My Beloved Smother.\nYoung examples are shown sympathetically, older ones are usually Acceptable Targets because no one can be a badass if he always obeys his mother's instructions (unless she's encouraging him to be a badass which would make her more of an Action Mom). Note the Double Standard in this trope, as a girl with a controlling father is almost never Played for Laughs.\nA young boy has a better chance of escaping mommy's patronage than an adult \u2014 who will, if anything, end up with a domineering wife instead. Sometimes an Oedipus Complex is involved. Rescue is unlikely: there aren't many Action Girls running around looking for poor oppressed boys. So there's the real danger that Momma's boy will grow old alone, until smother dies, when it's too late to change their ways and set right what went wrong.\nTo every Momma's Boy there is a Boy's Momma, of course.\nAlthough the trope is usually played as inherently negative, it can also be portrayed in a more positive light, becoming essentially a gender-inversion of Daddy's Girl in which mother and son are simply very close and utterly adore each other, often to the exclusion of the father (if he's even around to begin with); and while the well-meaning mother might naturally welcome the idea of her son getting hooked, the usual doting and spoiling with which she treats her son might be a bit overwhelming for potential Love Interests... if she didn't accidentally scare them off with her overprotectiveness first. This form is still likely to be Played for Laughs, but in a more endearing way.\nCompare Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas. See Mommy Issues for when this trope gets violent.

Or if it's somehow in canon.

In it, they receive and fertilize the eggs of their mates, and carry them to term. Not quite the same as a mammalian pregnancy (or the few fish and reptiles that birth live young), but it certainly appears as such to human eyes, especially when the young leave the pouch.\nThis is theoretically possible in real life. A Scientist was able to implant an embryo in the abdominal wall of a male baboon, and others report that it is indeed possible to get a man pregnant if the embryo is planted at the proper spot, but only if the man is pumped full of pregnancy hormones. The embryo creates its own placenta, it turns out.note http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-07/male-pregnancy-dangerous-proposition Unfortunately, the abdominal wall is not designed to detach from the placenta, resulting in massive bloody injury.

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "The Fighting Narcissist is arrogance and pride incarnate. He is the most beautiful, the most perfect, your superior in every way. And should you doubt this fact, he will make you pay for your folly, severely.\nThe Fighting Narcissist is a common character type in action series, especially common in martial arts media. He is a formidable fighter who happens to be handsome, extremely so, and takes pride in that fact to the point of capital sin. To him (and it's almost always him, not her) there is no one more beautiful or talented than himself, and to him both concepts are synonymous. He doesn't just happen to be both beautiful and talented, he's beautiful because he's talented, and vice versa.\nHe is selfish, vain, and confident of himself, and condescending to anyone and everyone else. Physically, he tends to be slim, tall and fair, but with defined musculature. He will have Caucasian features, even if he's not actually Caucasian. He will be refined in speech and manners, with a tinge of condescension in his speech. He is usually quite seductive, perhaps even refined and charming, but he is nowhere near as pleasing as he might seem at first glance. Beauty is an obsession to him, and often he describes his actions in these terms (\"My fighting style is the most beautiful\", or \"Seeing blood run is a thing of beauty\", for example).\nThis is manifested in exotic weapons, fashionable clothing, body modification, even the use of makeup or masks. You can tell a character is a Fighting Narcissist at first glance: his appearance is genuinely striking. He also tends to be quite wealthy, and a member of the upper crust of society.\nThis attitude does not lend itself to altruism: Fighting Narcissists are almost universally bad. They have no friends, few allies, and innumerable enemies. They see no one as their equal, and any alliance will be one of convenience. They might sometimes be a villain's Dragon, but have no loyalty to their master beyond convenience, and might even try to take the top seat themselves. The character is usually used as a formidable antagonist to The Hero who is thoroughly unlikeable and irredeemable.\nAs much arrogance as he might display, he is a talented fighter, dangerously so. Fighting styles lean towards the acrobatic and eccentric (they are mostly very fast). Another particular characteristic, curiously, is Combat Pragmatism. While all opponents are beneath him, no method of achieving victory is. He will use hidden weapons, underlings, and all other sorts of nasty surprises. Victory is all that matters to him, and he sees using underhanded tactics as him being smarter and more cunning. Honor means nothing to him, since honor is, to a certain point, an altruistic attitude, and he always looks out for number one.\nAnother particular characteristic of a Fighting Narcissist is his attitude towards sexuality. By his definition, any other person is inferior to him, so he is often not actively sexually interested in anyone else. While often effeminate, he is rarely actively interested in men, although he might become obsessed with another fighter who's actually beautiful and talented as well. On the other side of the spectrum, his attitude towards women is almost universally, irredeemably bad. A Fighting Narcissist tends to abuse women and finds much amusement in it. If he actually considers a woman attractive, it is to the point of obsession, and this relationship can lead to massive amounts of Foe Yay. Conversely, if the Fighting Narcissist is effectively gay, he'll almost universally be an Effeminate Misogynistic Guy. The bottom line is that a Fighting Narcissist generally does not deign anyone to be worthy of his desire, and any desire he might have for someone is ALWAYS unhealthy.\nIf a hero actually proves himself superior in anything, the Fighting Narcissist does not take it well. His high opinion of himself does not allow him to take defeat in any way lightly, and any humiliation he is subjected to instills irrational hatred in him. Oh, and scarring him in ANY way, especially in the face, will enrage him to the point of murderous insanity. If he doesn't get killed (or kill himself), expect him to act the part of Beauty to Beast, wear a mask and Black Cloak, and break every mirror he sees.\nWhile he can be ambitious and seek power, the main reason a Fighting Narcissist actually fights is self-gratification. He does not fight to prove himself, because he has nothing to prove: in his mind, he's already perfect. He does not seek a challenge, because such petty behavior is beneath him. More often than not, he fights out of boredom and bloodlust: he enjoys fighting and enjoys causing pain, period. Although rarely needing to work, he will often be a gangster, contract killer, or bodyguard; basically, professions that expose him to violence. He might also be a Serial Killer who uses fighting as an excuse to commit murder.\nThe character can also be used in a less extreme (i.e. non-murderous but still violent) fashion in lighter media: pro wrestling, for example, has myriad examples of arrogant and vain fighters. Also, very rarely, a Fighting Narcissist might actually be convinced to leave the dark side, but this is exceedingly rare, and many times it ends in his ultimate demise.\nRelated to Beauty Is Bad, and Agent Peacock. Contrast Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy, who, while also condescending of others and a powerful fighter, is not obsessed with his looks nor inherently evil, and Gorgeous George, whose obsessions lead to ambiguity more than arrogance and is friendly with the females to heighten the ambiguity. Spiritual brother to the Smug Super. Often a successful blow to the face will be a Berserk Button. The Fighting Narcissist also parallels the Combat Sadomasochist in terms of the Seven Deadly Sins: where the Narcissist has Vanity/Pride as a staple, the Sadomasochist is into Lust. In Manga, this type of character is referred to as the narusisuto, a long-haired, effeminate self-admirer." }

After The Good King dies, he will almost inevitably be followed by a Sketchy Successor.\nLike The High Queen, the Good King runs the risk of being a Mary Sue if his writers are not careful. Because of this the Good King will rarely be the main character but may serve as The Mentor to the protagonist. If the protagonist is one of his children expect his Papa Wolf tendencies to come into play.\nMay be Happily Married to The High Queen thus a Ruling Couple.

Yes, even the Dads who appear to be nothing but creampuff can be tough guys when they need to be, and he bases it all on his years of military service.\nOften this is pulled in situations where a younger (almost always male) character needs to be browbeaten or intimidated. Whether the dad was merely a Marine, or the equivalent of FOXHOUND, at some point, they'll bring it up in a not-so-casual way when they need to remind the younger character that they aren't as soft and yielding as they seem to be.\nQuite a few female characters are given a Veteran Dad as an excuse for why she's tough and independent, but it can also be a Freudian Excuse if he was a tyrannical martinet who lorded over his family with an iron hand. Sometimes this allows female characters to have access to unusual skills or assets, on the assumption that senior military officers use their aviation regiments as their kid's private chauffeurs.\nThis effect can also happen if Dad used to be a cop, or a government agent of some sort. In comedies, it often turns out that yeah, Dad was in the Army... but he was a cook, or a file clerk, or a mechanic, or had some other less than intimidating job.\nThis was a Justified Trope not too long ago for American families, given the almost back-to-back nature of World War II, The Korean War, and The Vietnam War.

He will sometimes attempt to purchase the services of local prostitutes.\nOften referred as the source of various pictures of excess luxury in Snopes.com's photography section, claiming they have, for example, cars made of solid silver, or coated in diamonds. (Back when Texans were the ones considered super rich, one example was the Texan who gave away his Cadillac and bought another one once the ashtrays were full. Yeah, and he smoked too, it was that far back.)\nThis character type is often brought in to teach a character An Aesop about putting his friends before monetary gain. This often involves the Sheikh innocently offering said character a large reward for a task that involves stepping on the character's friends in order to succeed.\nA common outcome is that the character fulfills the requirement while managing to help his friends as well, but he then turns down the reward because he's learned that money isn't the only thing in the world.\nIn the present climate, they might be involved in financing terrorism. Sometimes The Con will involve someone using this trope and posing as a rich Arab to help explain a source of abundant but eccentric money for the mark.\nThey also turn up a lot in Romance Novels along with older depictions of the Arab Sheikh where they are dark, brooding, passionate and ruling everything he surveys in his desert kingdom with the same tenacity as he takes the woman. Sheikh romance actually gave us the term \"bodice ripper\" due to the common kidnap-rape-love plots where the Arab can get away with being beyond normal constraints in how he treats the heroine due to his exoticness. He'll still have the education of Lord Nelson though and the manners of a prince which is kind of the point: these books want someone who lives in the closest thing to a modern lavish royal court and acts like the Black Death hasn't gone out of fashion.

Likely he will be head of The Clan, a Cool Old Guy and of course a Badass Grandpa. But younger versions are allowed though usually not too young. Just as an Apron Matron is a Badass woman whose formidability is tied to running the family, he is a man whose formidability is associated in the same way.\nHe will naturally have traditional ideas about how family responsibility should be run, thinking for instance that Manly Men Can Hunt, but women should Stay in the Kitchen. There may be subtleties to his opinions in this matter of course, but that does not change the basic theme. These specialty differences will naturally distinguish him from an Apron Matron as well as causing Values Dissonance with many.\nHe will likely be an Overprotective Dad and perhaps a Knight Templar Parent. On the plus side he will almost certainly be a very efficient Papa Wolf if any of his people are in danger. And he will definitely be the family's Team Dad, whatever else he is. Villainous Patriarchs will often be Abusive Parents, and/or a Fallen Hero . They might also be The Don in the Mafia. Heroic ones will tend to have rough edges, though they will often be the Mentor for children, nephews, and grandchildren. This kind of character is often also a Determined Homesteader, and a Wasteland Elder.\nA common plot is where the Patriarch is too much The Stoic to give a So Proud of You until the very end, which of course will likely be a Crowning Moment of Heartwarming (unless it is meant to tragically come too late). And if a Patriarch is married to an Apron Matron, then we shall have something to see... This trope may be less common now and milder father-figures seem to be somewhat in vogue, but it still persists.\nSimilarly, the Patriarch's overbearing authority may crush his sons into mere Nice Guys, whom he can not respect for their spinelessness. A nastier sort may try to crush rebellion with the threat of his will and finally despise them as the spineless Nice Guys and Dutiful Sons he made them, declare them Inadequate Inheritor, and opt for Passed Over Inheritance. This may be why the Black Sheep is his favorite..\nSee also Reasonable Authority Figure, A Father to His Men.

Most forms of media will typically portray the Officer and a Gentleman as being a member of the upper-class in whatever society he originates, and almost undoubtedly attended a Military Academy. If this character is a British officer (or speaking with an English accent), you can often tell whether he is an officer and a gentleman because he will almost invariably speak with a Received Pronunciation (i.e., the Queen\u2019s English). If he's American, he will either be a Southerner with a soft voice but pronounced Tidewater or Dixie accent (especially if in the Army), or a Northeastern gent with Mid-Atlantic tones (particularly in the Navy).\nBesides typically being a member of the upper crust, an officer and gentleman is personified by his behavior: No matter how savage the fighting, no matter how pitiless the combat, the officer almost never lets his base nature take over. He will remain polite, and even in the worst of situations will always retain his sense of propriety, often unfailingly displaying a Stiff Upper Lip. If a more clever sort, he may be a Gentleman Snarker. After all, a gentleman is not a mere label, but a way of life.\nFor example, an officer and a gentleman will rarely if ever cuss, and never knowingly in the presence of a lady. He will rarely drink to the point of inebriation, unless it is used for comedic purposes or to tragically show how the war may be taking a toll on him. He would never, ever take advantage of a lady, and will be very protective of women, both of their persons and their sensibilities, even when it is not merited. Further, if you insult his honour, or worse, the honour of a lady he fancies, you may earn yourself a challenge to a duel, unless profuse apology is the next thing out of your mouth. Otherwise, expect a fair, gentlemanly duel in which he will proceed to carve you into cutlets. However, he would not think of fighting dirty, and most certainly Would Not Shoot a Civilian on purpose. On the other hand, if he is evil, he might have some of his less honourable henchmen do the Dirty Business for him. Further, whether good or bad, he will always keep his word. . .after all, he gave his word as a gentleman. Characters typifying this trope often have the habit, for better or worse, of displaying Honour Before Reason.\nDo not misunderstand\u2014this fellow can be just as deadly as any other warrior; often more so, because one aspect that is often used with this trope is the fact that the more experienced officers are typically very composed and often have Nerves of Steel, making them less likely to act irrationally or misstep. However, while his training and experience may have forged him into a very skilled fighter, he will rarely be a Combat Pragmatist, and can often fall victim to more unsporting chaps.\nWhen it comes to actual leadership ability, the Officer and a Gentleman runs the gamut. If portrayed in a good light, the officer will be shown as being a Reasonable Authority Figure, like The Brigadier, and if he takes pains to look out for his soldier\u2019s wellbeing, he is A Father to His Men. In a really positive light, they may be shown to be great front-line leaders and warriors as well, playing the role of Colonel or General Badass. If they are being portrayed in a negative light, they will be the General Ripper or The Neidermeyer. If they are cruel and/or incompetent, they will most likely be portrayed as a General Failure. While these more negative incarnations may be just as dedicated to politeness and etiquette as the good ones, their good behaviour is reserved for their superiors and people of proper social rank, rather than the rabble of men they lead. Further, the evil officer would not hesitate saying \"We Have Reserves.\" After all, the only ones whose lives are at risk are the commoner soldiers, and who cares about them?\nRemember, what separates this character from the Proud Warrior Race Guy or the Warrior Poet is not only the character\u2019s devotion to honour, but to a set of \"gentlemanly\" principles, which include good manners and etiquette. Most representations of the officer and gentleman are most certainly Lawful Good or at least Lawful Neutral. If on the side of the antagonists, or the major antagonist himself, he will often be Lawful Evil, and is often portrayed as an Anti-Villain. Satirical versions of this trope are often represented as being Lawful Stupid.\nCompare with Knight Errant and Knight in Shining Armor. Contrast Up Through the Ranks (for an officer who isn't a gentleman) and Gentlemen Rankers (when a gentleman isn't an officer). If during peacetime the Officer and a Gentleman was an academic, then he is a Gentleman and a Scholar. If there's focus on the gentleman part then he follows the code of Old-School Chivalry.\nNot to be confused with the film, An Officer and a Gentleman, the 1982 movie with Richard Gere and Deborah Winger." }

Light blond guys are much more likely to be portrayed as evil than dirty blond guys.\nIn the 1980s, this trope was almost inescapable, particularly in teen movies. The Jerk Jock in these movies was more often than not blond - and the hero was virtually always dark-haired. But before that blonds were often heroes, so this may be a Cyclic Trope, albeit with a longer cycle time than that for female \"bad hair colors.\" That said, it has certainly become a much more prevalent trope in the days since World War II, which may be responsible for this, since the Nazis did love blonds. Note also the above-mentioned tendency for a long-haired blond villain to be a Sissy Villain, thus implying that blond hair on a man is by nature effeminate, and reinforcing the trope that the epitome of manliness is still Tall, Dark and Handsome.\nOften synonymous with Light Is Not Good; after all, blond guys are more often associated with an angelic appearance than black haired ones.\nCompare Evil Redheads, White Hair, Black Heart, and Evil Albino.

When they want to get fancy, they'll wear fringes as well. The whole ensemble is often topped with a coonskin cap.\nThey also usually sport a very large beard and rather long hair, though if they are the main character they will often have no beard, or a much smaller, scruffier one.\nCommon equipment includes various traps, a rifle (often anachronistic), and of course a really big knife, either a Bowie Knife, or an Arkansas Toothpick.\nWhen they are the heroes of the piece, they are often employed as scouts or trackers.\nAs the heyday of mountain trappers was before that of cattle drives, he may be visibly older than the cowboys and other stock characters. His gun will often be out of date (as previously noted) and he may speak in a strange or antiquated way.\nThey are often shown alternating between fighting, and hanging out with the local natives, sometimes doing both at the same time with two different tribes. Their other common enemy is the grizzly bear, and they are often shown killing them in hand to hand combat.\nIn newer media they are often portrayed having native wives. This was quite common historically but didn't appear in many older works due to stronger interracial marriage taboos than now.\nThey are often portrayed as incredibly strong, being The Big Guy of western characters. This is also one of the character types most prone to going native.\nSee also Prospector and Nature Hero." }

In essence, a Cock Fight is what happens when the vying between the two suitors escalates into open hostility. Often occurs if neither was aware of the existence of the other, or when one has been courting the girl for a while. Typically, the fighters tend to focus on each other with the woman becoming secondary goal or, in a nastier tone, treated as a trophy.\nAs the title implies, this trope is Always Male and is very different from a Betty and Veronica situation in its execution. Namely, it is more about posturing and machismo and much less about emotions; it tends to be more violent and physical, instead of being catty and verbal.\nThis is a staple of romantic films but it can show up in any type of work. Usually, this happens before the girl's heart is clearly settled between her two suitors but, even when her choice is made and spoken out, there is still a chance for the Cock Fight to turn up since Romantic False Leads are not known for giving up easily. If the lossing side refuses to acknowledge defeat, the next step can be If I Can't Have You.\nWhen it comes to the competition itself, it is generally about displaying protectiveness, doing nice things for the girl, strength contests and other kinds of symbolic measurements comparisons, preferably in front of her. More often than not, things can get out of hand \u2014 sometimes up to physical confrontation \u2014 if one of the suitors gets too close to the girl in front of his rival, or worse still, if he openly claims the girl for himself.\nDuring such conflicts, the girl can either stay neutral or try to intervene whether or not her choice is made. If she takes the second option, what she does can go from trying to soothe the guys's differences, telling them to shut up and stop fighting over her, or even get the HELL out until they stop being stupid.\nThis is a subtrope of the Love Triangle and related to Triang Relations. Highly probable in a Two Guys and a Girl setting. Often happens after a Green-Eyed Epiphany.\nContrast Courtly Love, If I Can't Have You, and Stalker with a Crush. See also Opposites Attract Revenge for what this might lead to.\nNot related to Cat Fight, but if two girls have mutual interest over the same dude, they can get into one. It rarely overlaps with a Dogfight. (Ace Pilots are too classy for that).\nThis trope is named for the rooster as a metaphor for a male animal which fights over a mate though the double-meaning is not unintended. For literal animal fights, see Beastly Bloodsports and Mon. It has at most metaphorical connection with a fight between two male reproductive organs.\n\nExamples" }

When he is finally exposed to the outside world, it becomes apparent that the character is out of his depth. He doesn't realize how difficult and dangerous life outside his palace really is, and as a result he is a Horrible Judge of Character, easily duped by conmen and stolen from by thieves. Often he thinks he can talk his way out of confrontations, or throw money at any problem, and generally not recognizing, at least initially, that bad things could actually happen to him out in the real world. He will often be puzzled and even intrigued by the goings on of everyday life, resulting in Mundane Object Amazement. Sometimes the irony will be taken further as the Sheltered Aristocrat proclaims himself to be an expert, having studied the lower class from textbooks, only to be proved very wrong. Often he has no idea how to do common, everyday activities and is thus rather helpless if he finds himself on his own. He may also be unaware of any suffering his people are really going through in his kingdom until he comes face to face with it.\nThese characters tend to fall into three main types: a plucky-type with child-like innocence and kindness, a silly and cowardly-type who is treated like a joke, and snobby and superior type that can be cruel. Most of the types have a good chance to mature into the honourable and melancholic Wise Prince or the practical and down-to-Earth Princely Young Man during their adventures, though the cowardly and snobbish types have just as much of a chance to turn their back on the real world and shut themselves back in their palace, if they can.\nThis trope can include any character, not just princes, who are sheltered in this way.

When deciding to issue a loan, he has to carefully consider whether the debtor has a decent chance of paying it back, because a bad loan hurts the debtor, the bank and its customers. On the other hand, it's more likely he has a small shrine to Ebenezer Scrooge and says \"No\" because the debtor is at fault for being poor in the first place and he wouldn't know how to use the money anyway. When it comes time to make loans, he'll give them out gleefully with Read The Fine Print details making it a Leonine Contract that turn up the interest rates like a thermostat until it's time for the Repo Man to impound some unfortunate ambitious dreamer's property.\nAnd this is just a branch manager \u2014 the bank's CEO is probably a Corrupt Corporate Executive who would rather embezzle and gamble with the customers' money than make prudent investments. More generally, the Morally Bankrupt Banker is likely an Obstructive Bureaucrat, Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil, and a Rules Lawyer.\nA quick way to tell whether a banker is meant to be sympathetic is which of the following is his attitude toward money: \"That's the bank's money\" (unsympathetic), \"That's my money\" (really unsympathetic) or \"That's our customers' money\" (sympathetic). Another is his reaction when he hears a plea for help. A snide remark about \"all the sob stories\" he hears is pretty much this trope's Kick the Dog. On the other hand, if he goes out of his way to offer the customer an extension, move around deadlines, extend refinancing offers, or otherwise give the customer at least a chance at paying back a debt or getting a much-needed loan, then he's likely averting this trope and being sympathetic.\nThis may possibly be a Cyclical Trope; examples became popular during and after The Great Depression in the 1930s, and more recently in the global recession of 2008.\nSee also the Loan Shark and the Evil Debt Collector." }

We'll be listing both examples of intentional and unintentional Kilt Service here. It is worth mentioning, however, there are examples of this definitely not being fanservice, when the Kilt is worn by a not traditionally attractive man... then again, different strokes for different folks and all that.\nOften if a Man in a Kilt appears, someone will suggestively ask if is he \"a real Scotsman\", i.e. is anything worn under the kilt? If he's a \"real Scotsman\" he might say nothing is worn under the kilt: it's all in very good condition. (Historically, this is a case of artistic license; since the \"nae trews\" style of kilt-wearing originated with a single British Army regiment; we also understand that it is permissible to wear underpants with a kilt at present, since there is a lady on the Scottish throne. And The Other Wiki notes that participants in traditional Highland events like the Highland Games or country dance contests are generally required by the rules to wear something under their kilt.) A typical answer to \"what are you wearing under it\" if the man in question is feeling a little mischievous is, \"Good girls don't ask, bad girls find out for themselves\" and, if he just wants to be a total wiseass, \"Shoes.\"\nThe kilt is also invariably the Scottish tartan Great or Wee kilt, despite the kilt being considerably Older Than They Think.\nFurthermore - in Scotland, the kilt is part of Highland dress and not universal to the entire country. Lowlanders (including historical figures like John Knox and Robert Burns) would never have worn kilts as they are the mainstay of the 'Teuchter' (or Highlander). This being the subject of \"Donald Where's Yer Troosers?\" by comic singer Andy Stewart.\nCompare Shirtless Scene.\nOh, and... it's probably best not to tell a Scotsman he's wearing a skirt.... because if you do, you'll get kilt." }

All the same rules apply, but a couple variations do tend to show up, expressing different ideas of what constitutes male and female \"perfection\". Also referred to as \"Gary Stu\" or \"Larry Stu\" (for those who prefer rhyming to alliteration and whose dialect has the Mary-marry merger), \"Mary Joe\", or \"Marty Sam\".\nOnce upon a time, Mary Sue didn't really do very much, because a woman who took an active role in dramatic events was unwomanly and, by definition, not perfect. So Mary Sue radiated a soft glow of purity and beauty into the narrative around her and had people fall in love with her a lot. And this side of her lineage still shows, even as changes in society have allowed women to get their katanas out and fly and so forth.\nMarty Stu, however, is usually restricted to being a creature of action since men who do not take an active role in dramatic events are unmanly and, by definition, not perfect (Non-Action Guy tends to be looked upon with disdain). So Marty Stu is the personification of action, action and more action. Or, if he is of an intellectual bent, he thinks his way through problems, inventing whole new branches of science and technology in the process. In contrast to Mary Sue who has been freed to play an active and/or passive role, Marty Stu is almost never seen taking on his sister's old school Purity Sue role: passive motivator of others through his purity, beauty and helplessness. When he does, it is almost exclusively the territory of wimpified Possession Sues in Slash.\nMarty Stu is devastatingly handsome (or if not, possessed of a strange, saturnine magnetism) and desired by all significant women, yes, but romance is not likely to be the main dish. He's an unstoppable fighter, a rogue agent, a fearless freedom fighter, a master of disguise. However, as times have changed, just as Mary's acquired a bratty temper, Marty's had the occasional opportunity to show his softer side.\nOnce upon a time, Mary Sues were noticed and hated to a much greater degree than Marty Stus. It was almost as if male characters were forgiven for being implausibly plastic because they upheld stereotypically male virtues such as toughness, courage, and heterosexual promiscuity. And while men have finally begun to demand more realistic protagonists, making Marty Stu somewhat less acceptable it is still clear that Marty Stus still get passes far more frequently than Mary Sues resulting in quite a fair number of male canon sues who conversely are praised rather than criticized. Part of this may be due to Most Fanfic Writers Are Girls as well as Most Writers Are Male. Both female and male writers for analogous but different reasons tend to like such characters.\nSee also The Ace, which is usually made as a nod to the less realistic male characters of old and plays it as a supporting character for comedic purposes.\nNo examples, please.

If and when an impressionable person (usually his mother, boss, or love interest) comes by, there will be a sudden flurry of activity as the hopeless male shoves everything into a closet in an attempt to instantly clean the place. A variation of this trope appears if the male character is living at home with his parents; in this case, expect his room to be an island of grunge while the rest of the house is immaculately well-kept. Trash of the Titans may be invoked if the mess is of epic proportions.\nA supertrope to A Day In Her Apron, but while that trope contrasts the skills of a couple, this one focuses solely on the inability of men (married or single) to keep house.

Young single men living alone or with other male roommates may not have the time nor the inclination to keep house well, especially when their abode is mostly use for sleeping. On the other hand, it stretches credibility when a married man or a father plays this straight and the men mentioned earlier put less emphasis on housework rather than its absence.\nContrary to popular belief, this trope was around well before modern feminism. In fact, Betty Friedan pointed out the Unfortunate Implications for women as well as men in The Feminine Mystique in 1963: not only is it rather insulting toward men, but if men simply can't be expected to keep house decently, it follows that housekeeping must be the woman's responsibility, even if she'd rather pursue a career and split the domestic duties. Today this is almost, but not quite, a Dead Horse Trope, especially in Comedies. In many works, excessive cleanliness and thoughtful decoration in a man's home is sometimes seen as a sign of homosexuality (feeding an equally-pervasive stereotype that all gay men are awesome housekeepers) or just plain bonkers; a slovenly bachelor is therefore a shorthand for heterosexuality. In other works, however, it is a shorthand for bratty, self-obsessed immaturity, and so a bad bet that way.\nContrast House Husband and Real Men Wear Pink; compare and contrast with Feminine Women Can Cook.

Using slaves as rowers was to be avoided. If a ship full of free rowers was boarded, they would fight alongside the marines and other personnel. If a ship full of slave rowers was boarded, the boarders would say \"Hey, you know those Jerks who beat you and force you to row, we are going to kill them!

The ideal \"Hollywood Bully\" is invariably a physically imposing, thuggish, Obviously Evil bigot who terrorizes victims through overt, obvious physical force that can easily be recognized by anyone.\nThis kind of bullying easily lends itself to the visual media, since a loud, fleeting schoolyard scuffle is much more interesting to watch on the big screen than hours of more subtle psychological torment. A climactic fistfight with a bully also provides a much simpler (and easier) way for writers to resolve a conflict, whereas psychological/social bullying doesn't give viewers a loud spectacle, it is harder for adults to recognize and resolve (and harder for victims to prove), and it requires far more attention to Character Development to make it convincing (since a bully has to be believably popular to have the circle of friends needed to pull it off). At the end of the day, delving into the consequences of scrapes and bruises is a far easier job for writers than delving into the consequences of depression, self-loathing and social isolation.\nInterestingly, this represents something of a gender Double Standard as well, since thuggish bullies in fiction will almost exclusively be male, with the most common of such being the Jerk Jock, whereas the few times that psychological bullying is shown, it will exclusively be the domain of petty, giggling Alpha Bitches who torment less popular girls with verbal barbs. With female bullies, physical fights will shown to be the incredibly rare exception to the rule, while the opposite is true of male bullies. Much like with brutish male bullies, though, dealing with a bullying Alpha Bitch will invariably be as simple as dispatching her with a cathartic series of pranks or a simple verbal smackdown.\nThis is on its way to becoming a Discredited Trope with the recent rash of cyberbullying and bullying-related suicides making news, but it only makes the few works that cling to this misconception stick out like a sore thumb. With tighter security in schools in the post-Columbine era, fistfights in crowded high school hallways in full view of crowds are also far less believable that they once were. For this reason, it also tends to be far more common in works that are at least a decade old. However, due to Values Dissonance, it is still Truth in Television in the United Kingdom, especially as there have been well-publicised reports of teachers being unable to control their students there - so it is still an Omnipresent Trope in British educational programmes (e.g. Waterloo Road) and a Cyclic Trope elsewhere in British society, despite cyberbullying being common.\nSub-Trope of The Bully.

Differs from Sensitive Guy and Manly Man in that the Noble Male is still very much considered \"manly\" \u2014 but is so in a more chivalrous fashion, rather than in an aggressive fashion.\nThe Noble Male can be the Betty in a male Betty and Veronica love triangle. Also related is Red Oni, Blue Oni, with the Noble Male being the Blue to the Roguish Male's Red.

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "Like Dastardly Whiplash, this is an oddly specific character. Often a villain, or at the very least extremely shady, the Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit is where the Corrupt Hick intersects with the Villainous Glutton. They are always obese. They always speak with a strong Southern accent, normally an upper class drawl. They are almost always dressed in a white suit, cane optional. If it's not truly white, it'll be pale enough to have the same effect. If it's someplace in the Deep South, like Mississippi or Louisiana, they will be extremely sweaty and constantly dabbing themselves with a handkerchief when not lazily fanning themselves. This is optional in places like Kentucky, but they will occasionally manage to be sweaty even in an Appalachian winter.\nThe root of the stereotype is in actual Southern fashions, combined with negative stereotypes of plantation owners. The white suit was an enduring Southern fashion down to the '70s, and can still be seen to this day, because the South is hot, not to mention humid. The best such suits were made of linen, which is naturally moisture-wicking and highly thermally conductive; the next-best quality was seersucker, a cotton weave in which most of the cloth stays away from the skin. (Seersucker suits are fashionable to this day in Washington, DC, which is very much a part of the South's subtropical climate zone.) Being white meant that the suit reflected light, and so didn't get hot as fast as other fabrics; it also allowed its wearer to show off that he didn't have to do anything that would get his clothing dirty.\nHistorical figures who sported the Southern white suit included Mark Twain and Colonel Sandersnote yes, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken is a historical figure; but neither of them was particularly fat or particularly villainous. Mark Twain's satires of Southern aristocracy might have been the Trope Codifier here; Colonel Grangerford, from Huckleberry Finn, might be an example.\nThe villainous Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit is a shameless glutton; the usual objects of his gluttony are mainstream Southern foods (sweet, fatty dishes which originated in the wet, cold, rainy Scottish Lowlands, and were definitely not adapted to suit the wet, hot, rainy Southern ones), but he's often found in association with gumbo, suggesting that he may have Cajun origins.\nHe occasionally has Jabba Table Manners, and often has a careless, laid-back manner. He's probably Nouveau Riche and quite possibly a Corrupt Hick; he's almost certainly not an aristocratic, genteel, warlike Southern Gentleman.\nHe might be rich by anyone's standards; or he might just be better-off than the rural poverty that surrounds him. One way or the other, he can afford very large quantities of very good food, and it's not at all unlikely that he gets the money from being part of, or the leader of, a corrupt local government.\nOne occasionally sees an uncorrupt, or out-and-out heroic, character of this sort. They sometimes sell food; at other times, they, like the Southern Gentleman, are lawyers.\nFor non-fat, non-sweaty, non-Southerners, who are unlikely to be corrupt but who may have a different set of villainous characteristics, see Man in White. For Southerners too blue-blooded to sweat, see Southern Gentleman. For characters who are more powerful and even less genteel, see Corrupt Hick (remembering that there's a lot of overlap). For villains who eat a great deal, Southern or not, see Villainous Glutton. And for other stereotypes of the obese, compare and contrast Fat Bastard, Fat Idiot, and Fat Slob.\nSince this is (more or less) a Villain Trope, No Real Life Examples, Please! (More or less.)" }

The Great Depression Theme Park isn't complete without these boxcar barons.\nHaving been everywhere, seen everything and met everyone, hobos are full of tall tales and song \u2014 not to mention sage advice.

When and how a hobo receives his nickname is unclear, but every hobo has one \u2014 it's usually \"Boxcar\" something.\nHobos are allergic to hard work, unless promised beans or alcohol, and are magnetically attracted to pies cooling on the window sill (whose aroma may cause spontaneous levitation).

He's a literal bastard, and the reason for the negative connotation of the word.\nBorn with the shame of unmarried parents, he is marginalized at best, reviled and banished at worst (not to mention unable to inherit), but unlike his more sympathetic counterpart, the Heroic Bastard, the Bastard Bastard is not trying to rise above society's expectations. Instead, his Parental Abandonment has created the ultimate Freudian Excuse. He's the Jerkass Woobie who's got it in for his father, his siblings, or maybe even the world. His issues have driven him to seek revenge, or made him vulnerable to manipulation by the forces of Evil. Generally male, although female examples are becoming more common.\nThis trope can be found in any society where rank or wealth can be inherited, if it also has a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring\u2014making it Older Than Dirt.\nWhile not exactly a Discredited Trope, the subversion is more common today. Modern audiences have a less stringent view toward children and wedlock and tend to be more accepting of a literal bastard character. While modern settings don't really make use of this trope as plenty of modern fiction deals with settings that draw inspiration from the middle ages (particularly high fantasy but plenty of other genres too) it'll continue to be relevant for as long as people want to write about aristocracies and so forth.\nStands a good chance of being a Manipulative Bastard.

It's the reason why Compensating for Something is, by its very nature, an insult \u2014 everybody knows that a real man has a big penis. A heroic character, when his penis is mentioned (which isn't all that often, except by innuendo), will usually have a big one.\nConsequently, this is also the reason why villainous or loser characters are portrayed as having a small penis, or something else small meant to represent a penis. It's a deficiency that makes them bad people, or at least not cool like the heroes are. By further extension, Good People Have Good Sex, to some degree because they're usually well-endowed.\nUnsurprisingly, most writers don't really think through the implications of this. This can result in the actual act of sex being physically impossible given the circumstances. Frequently the precise dimensions are given, which conjures up the image of the PoV-character getting out a tape measure.\nThere's a limit on how much this trope can apply in Real Life, regardless of personal preferences: if somebody's penis is too big for their partner's orifices, this could easily make it physically painful to have sex.\nObviously, this is a subtrope of Bigger Is Better. When a large penis has comedic value instead of sexual value, see Gag Penis. Contrast with Teeny Weenie, which is a penis which is smaller than the average, and often leads to mockery of the guy who has it because of this trope. See also IKEA Erotica. For female breasts that are big, it's either Buxom Is Better or Gag Boobs.\nWhen a writer goes extreme, then it can become a case of Anatomically Impossible Sex.

If the travellers have gone looking for the lost scientist or wizard then they are more likely to be seeking a Hermit Guru.\nIn most cases the Affably Evil lost scientist or wizard has either a dark secret or a sinister goal that requires the travellers. He may have a supporting cast of servants or slaves, and may also have a beautiful daughter to provide romantic interest, typically introduced in a No, Mr. Bond, I Expect You to Dine scene. He may be famously lost so that one of the heroes can fill in his Back Story by starting with \"I read about him at school...\". Any unusual equipment that he has is justified by A Wizard Did It.\nIf the lost scientist or wizard is not evil then he may have been secretly watching the party and decided that these people are worthy of help, usually some form of Applied Phlebotinum. The arrival of the right heroes can also induce a Heel-Face Turn on the part of an evil scientist/wizard, or induce a formerly good one to take off their Jade-Colored Glasses.\nThe earliest known version of this trope is The Tempest (making it Older Than Steam), in which the exiled wizard Prospero causes a storm in order to bring a party travelling by sea onto his island in order to wreak revenge. The setting of a lost wizard on an island won't work in the modern world, but the concept has been Recycled IN SPACE! several times, most famously in Forbidden Planet, with a scientist on a planet instead of a wizard on an island. The lost scientists in these versions lack Prospero's Invisibility Cloak, so only the dark secret or motive is kept hidden. Instead the relationship between the travellers and the scientist is used to drive a mystery plot with the travellers gradually realizing that all is not as it seems.\nThe Unbuilt Trope from which this came may have been the King in the Mountain.\n Examples" }

The macho man is forced to learn new skills, though he often finds creative ways to apply his action hero skills to a more domestic situation. Usually the children are bad or mischievous, and usually the \"Action Hero\" begins the movie \"hating children\" and gradually grows to love them over the course of the film.\nTo qualify as this trope, the casting is as important as the plot. A primary factor in Action Hero Babysitter is to see the actor in an unusual (for them) and often humorous situation. The specific details of the character are often less important than just the fact that they are a Badass or Action Hero, because that is what the actor invariably plays. This is similar to Playing Against Type, but instead of having the actor play someone unlike what they normally play, they play their regular character type but in an unusual situation.

Either way, his status as a rich blue blood allows for him to get quite good at this magic stuff, since he probably has nothing better to do. Usually the skill to use magic is seen as an appropriate sort of job for a gentleman to have, similar to being a Lawyer or banker. He'll also be a Sharp-Dressed Man, in dapper Victorian or Edwardian attire, possibly embellished to show off the fact that he's magical, and if he has a walking-stick it will no doubt be his wizard's staff or act as a magic focus at least once.\nBut even as a gentleman, such characters are usually considered to be quite strange and eccentric, even tricky and untrustworthy, no matter how polite their manner may appear to be. And as blue bloods, they might be quite proud and stuffy, looking down on the commoners and the muggles.

Very commonly, the women won\u2019t have names (or, if the trope is Played for Laughs, the guy simply can't remember their names and refers to them with a wide range of incorrect names), nor will they say anything: they\u2019re just there to act as props for the male character. If they do get to speak, it\u2019ll probably only be to imply that they\u2019re going to have sex with the man later. It is he who decides what they\u2019re going to do and where they're going to go, while the ladies just follow around and agree with everything the stud says. After all, men are defined by their actions and women by their passiveness. \"A lady on each leg\" is a variant of this trope that takes place when the man is sitting down, with the women at his feet. Or perhaps even one sitting on each knee.\nThe man in question is almost always a Hunk (handsome and manly), and at the same time a Casanova (successful sexual predator). He likely engages in sexual activities out of the blue, making him a Pornomancer, and very often the ladies follow him around because he's well endowed in the penis department. If he's accompanied by more than two women, then it would be a case of Sexy Man, Instant Harem. In promotional posters and artwork, the ladies are commonly found clinging to his feet. If the story is set in high school or college, then he'll probably be the Big Man on Campus.\nNot to be confused with Lover Tug of War, where two women are physically fighting over a man. On the contrary, the ladies of A Lady on Each Arm are passive to the point where they accept the fact that the man has other women for him as well.\nDue to gender double standards, this trope almost always applies to men, given that women are usually shamed for having multiple sexual partners (or even just one). On a further note, this trope almost exclusively applies to straight men, given that queer people that enjoy and fully explore their sexuality are usually villainized in media. Straight men, on the other hand, get to be badasses for having an active sex life and being in control of their surroundings. The man in question will also probably be white, since men of color with multiple partners very often come off as perverts in media.\nThe Japanese call this trope also \"a flower in each hand\" (両手に花, \"ryoute ni hana\").\n\nExamples" }

They're almost always not very intelligent and usually want to party and drink all day (and try to get laid) and will likely engage in Wacky Fratboy Hijinks. Despite the name, they don't have to be (or have been) in a fraternity in college. In a lot of ways it's an evolution of the Dumb Jock stereotype as they often fulfill the same role, although the Fratbro will not necessarily be an athlete (they will be big followers of sports, however). Also unlike the traditional jock, the Fratbro will often be a very big fan of soft drugs (particularly cannabis), and be portrayed as being pretty much harmless.\nThis is a subtrope of Men Are Uncultured, specifically designed around the idea that it's \"normal\" for young men to behave this way and sow their depraved \"oats\" before stepping foot in the real world. The ones who can't let go of this phase in their lives may grow up to be a Jaded Washout or The Stoner.\nUsually an Acceptable Target in pretty much any work not aimed at this demographic. If they're a main character, they'll usually be a Bromantic Foil (appropriately enough). One popular Aesop for this type of character is to become a Lady Killer In Love, especially if they Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest. Whether or not it works is a toss-up, as this sort of character can easily imply that the audience Should Not Do This Cool Thing.\nCompare Life of the Party and Wacky Fratboy Hijinx.

They singlehandedly fight the Monster of the Week and even rescue their action/magical girl friends when they are still learning how to use their powers/skills. They are more than capable of facing the Big Bad and his/her goons without powers.\nIn short, they are completely badass... Except whenever their action/magical girl friends are around. Then they somehow become very ineffective fighting against the Monster of the Week and are completely useless against the Big Bad. Sometimes, they even get demoted to Distressed Dude. Many times, they are not allowed to win a fight unless their girlfriends are somehow incapacitated. Most of the time they are somehow unable to get the same powers/abilities as their action/magical girl friends.\nOne potential (in-universe) explanation for this is that the boyfriend in question is a Badass Normal, while the \"girlfriend\" has actual magical powers, special abilities, or is a much better Badass Normal. And while the boy is no doubt skilled, he can't really compare to soul-eating monsters or the ability to shoot fire from one's hands.\nAnother explanation is that though the boy has powers of his own, and is more than a badass normal, he isn't the Chosen One, or lacks the local monster-killing MacGuffin, which the girl noticeably has.\nWhen this trope is played straight, it is used to denote Girl Power. This trope appears primarily in shows intended for girls, where the spotlight is supposed to be on the female characters as the heroes.\nCompare to the Worf Effect, where a Badass character is taken out easily to show how tough the new villain is. The difference between a Useless Boyfriend and the Worf Effect is the setting and how frequently the Badass in question is beaten down. The Worf Effect will overlap with Useless Boyfriend, but the Boyfriend is characterized by his uselessness. Though he may also serve a similar purpose, the \"Worf\" will be actually effective against a wide variety of enemies, and will gain victories for their side, whereas the Boyfriend serves as a punching bag until his girlfriend shows up.\nSee Girl Power, Action Girl, Informed Ability, Magical Girl, or Distressed Dude. Also look at Badass Decay. Contrast Faux Action Girl, which is a part of the Distaff Counterpart. The man's fear of becoming this trope is part of the driving force behind No Guy Wants an Amazon." }

People could truly be Fat and Proud. It has become more of a Forgotten Trope over time as most societies have themselves become more affluent and have access to more and healthier varieties of food. Such large-set people are not as usually considered as attractive by today's audience or in today's works, where they would more likely be considered Fat Slobs for their girth.\nBut while this is mostly true for women, it becomes a Double Standard with men. The sheer size of the Ugly Guy, Hot Wife page shows that Hollywood is more likely to let a fat man attract a lover with his personality and sense of humor. But per Rule of Funny, their beauty in another character's eyes is usually an Informed Attractiveness that doesn't even pretend to try to resonate with the audience.\nA very notable exception is in works that appeal to gay men. Chubby men are not always considered attractive in the gay community, especially in contexts where The Twink or the Bishōnen are considered the more marketable standard of beauty (ie, the majority of Western and Japanese works featuring gay men), and the rule of Hollywood Pudgy is in full force. But there is a sizable niche interest that finds them sexy and even Moe \u2014 these people are termed (for better or for worse) \"chubby chasers\". Among these include The Bear community, where body hair is the chief point of attractiveness, but most sexy chubbiness is also usually the order of the day.\nThe trope can also still be Played for Laughs when a chubby character sees himself as a Big Beautiful Man. Even then, it still often manages to come off as gay-for-oneself.\nLGBT Fanbase often gives Big Beautiful Man status to characters that were not (specifically) intended as such. This can apply to practically any chubby character. Even Santa Claus is not immune.\nThe Spear Counterpart of Big Beautiful Woman. Big Beautiful Man can overlap to some degree with Acrofatic, Bara Genre, The Bear, Big Fun, The Big Guy, Fat and Proud, Hollywood Pudgy and Stout Strength. In fact, this trope overlaps with The Bear so often that some people consider them the same trope \u2014 except that technically this trope is about body fat and the other trope is about body hair." }

Often looked at with disdain by the rest of the family who view him as an annoyance at the worst of times, the Dumbass Teenage Son is often times easily tricked or manipulated by his other family members, even those younger than him. He has no aspirations of getting an education or a \"real job\", usually thinking about becoming a rock star despite lacking in musical talent. Sometimes, this character tends to pepper his sentences with Totally Radical phrases like \"Dude!\" or \"Awesome!\".\nDumbass Teenage Sons are common in sitcoms, but can be found in other genres as well. Sometimes they are shown to be Book Dumb or knowledgeable about certain things others don't know, but not all the time. They are rarely if ever the Main Character or get focused on unless it's being viewed with contempt by the rest of the family.

In Eagleland, characters who angst about this are typically (though not always) of backgrounds which are typically uncircumcised. Because circumcision is most common in Jewish and Muslim cultures and in the USA (and American cultural satellites such as South Korea and the Philippines), this trope is a prime cause of Values Dissonance.\nIn the typical circumcision angst story, a male character either sees his buddies in the locker room and wonders why he's different, or thinks that his difficulty in the bedroom is because of it. He may be circumcised by the end without any medical necessity, resulting in a Broken Aesop. Not that this hasn't been inverted.\nThis trope has been in decline in recent years, likely as American circumcision rates are also in decline. If anything, an inverse trope is starting to appear, where men from cultures that do circumcise suddenly find themselves in cultures that don't, and receive the requisite stares from their peers.

Sex is something that just happens to the Accidental Pornomancer, even if they're apathetic or don't want it, and their own desires are completely inconsequential. Moral repercussions are either glossed over, or made to seem wrong, but still awesome. The Accidental Pornomancer is thus free from any responsibility, consequences, guilt or fault for what happened, even if they enjoy it.\nIn theory, it's the perfect escapist fantasy: the hero isn't \"perverted\" because this sexual encounter isn't something they, or \"normal\" people, would want. They aren't womanizing or slutting, because they couldn't say no, or the sex was really weird. Thus, there's plenty of Power Fantasy, but your hero can still be an Audience Surrogate. Further, this trope usually (but not always) averts Idealized Sex; when the sex is really awkward or weird, you can still have them feel insecure, and thus seem innocent.\nBecause of gender stereotypes, the Accidental Pornomancer is either Always Male or the sexual aggressors are Always Female. If you swap genders, the same situation invites Unfortunate Implications and Double Standards, perhaps unless the story was intended for women, but good luck with that. While the guy will be admired or seen as \"lucky\", the rare female version of this trope is usually an innocent being victimized or a ditzy, \"easy\" Slut.\nAlso, while the setup for this trope is the same as an Unwanted Harem, where it differs is that in the Harem Genre, the hero is usually chaste until the end. This hero sees action at some point during the story, and usually doesn't have to put in any work.\nAs such, this trope is prevalent in a lot of Pornography, Hentai, Ecchi, and H-Games.\nFor more information on the subject, check out the Analysis page.\nSubtrope to Chick Magnet (and in some cases, Clueless Chick Magnet specifically) and Really Gets Around.
