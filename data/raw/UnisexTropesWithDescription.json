This is why they spend so much time explaining things the protagonists already know. Popular in Science Is Bad stories, where you can bet the Mad Scientist in charge will have a tape recorder with him at all times that he's always dictating his progress to, Mr. Exposition is also an essential component of the Instructional Dialogue.

So, hiring a few good voice actors means you can take care of many, many characters with a small cast (especially if one or two actors are a Man of a Thousand Voices).\nOftentimes, this results in funny situations, like two characters played by the same person having intense conversations and heated arguments with each other. The talent is in making sure the audience doesn't know it. If jokes are made about this, it's Actor Allusion.\nIn voice acting, the process is fairly simple, with the actor just doing a different take (although some good voice actors can do it in real-time). The actor's vocal range is the only thing that might betray commonality.\nThis is sometimes actually invoked on purpose, as it can make you think, \"Ohey, they're a clone? Why didn't I realize that before?\"\nIn Live-Action this can be difficult, which requires split screen or otherwise splitting the image. This requires perfect synchronization between the different takes. Normally, the camera is stationary for this, but Back to the Future Part II pioneered a motion controlled camera that allows for complex panning shots that have the same actor in multiple roles.\nNot to be confused with I Can't Use These Things Together, Sounding It Out, Thinking Out Loud or Talking to Themself. Compare Holding Both Sides of the Conversation, which is an in-universe example of this trope, where a character is pretending to hold a conversation with another non-present (or non-existent) character, in order to maintain some kind of charade." }

A mentor to the officers under him, he takes a deep personal interest in their welfare and tries to keep them out of harm's way. He would never say, \"We Have Reserves\" (unless it would save more lives in the long run- but expect him to be torn up about it, though he may hide it almost perfectly\u2014and certainly never to make him look better). Staff officers, engineers, and the Camp Cook will be treated with respect and made to feel as valued as the troops on the front line, though he'll not put up with bureaucratic nonsense. He will never lay claim to work actually performed by his subordinates, and will try to pass the credit to where it's due if it is misattributed to him. He will accept responsibility for any mistakes, even if it was not entirely his fault, especially if the failure would result in severe punishment for a subordinate. He often follows up by treating his subordinate's mistakes as Career Building Blunders. And when his subordinates actually die, he will make sure to remember all of their names and faces.\nUsually a military mastermind who disdain wave attack carnages and instead will plan so that his faction will have the least casualties possible.\nStrategic or tactical blunders are usually the fault of those above him or below him. His career is often handicapped or cut tragically short by the incompetent High Command, his true worth appreciated only by the men he commanded. Or at least, that's the impression he projects to the troops.\nThis character generally cultivates a father-figure atmosphere. He is a source of morale, discipline and stability. Usually this is through a gentle reasoning tone, but sometimes he's a more strict (read harsh) father figure. In this instance expect a new soldier transferred to the unit to hate him, and for one of the older veterans to take him aside and tell a nice Pet the Dog story about the commanding officer. Sometimes all his soldiers are new; this will result in hatred until the soldiers either survive something that could have killed them, or accomplish a difficult objective, and realize that they would have died or failed without his strict training.\nHe is often utilized more as a device after he has left the scene, as an idealized counterbalance to the incompetent who succeeds him. This is probably because he's far more effective as a saint, and it'd be hard to maintain such an image when he's actually coordinating operations, especially cursed with Hollywood Tactics like he is. Indeed, an officer who learns You Are in Command Now may find his troops are Losing the Team Spirit over this commander's death\u2014though he can issue a Rousing Speech reminding them that the dead commander would be So Proud of You if they soldier on.\nSometimes he's used to make the troops unhappy with their new commander, even if he is a good one- similar to the \"You're Not My Mother\" response given even to kind substitute authority figures.\nOther times he's a character who gets called in to deliver an Aesop after the soldiers mess up. Or he might be a mostly off screen character who gives the main characters a reason to try and do better, and to be embarrassed when they make a stupid mistake.\nWhen an enemy, he is often the Worthy Opponent or Friendly Enemy. If he's a subordinate, the Big Bad's lack of concern for his men may be a source of Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal.\nDespite the title and the use of a male pronoun, this trope is sometimes Gender Flipped.\nMost of the movie and TV examples in The Captain are of this type.\nSister Trope to Officer and a Gentleman, and they may overlap. If he is a Blue Blood, he will not care that his soldiers are commoners. This often surprises other Blue Blood officers.\nRelated to The Last DJ, Benevolent Boss. Compare Papa Wolf and the aforementioned Team Dad. See also The Patriarch and Reasonable Authority Figure.\nContrast Sergeant Rock who is also super-competent, but his leadership style is nasty; The Neidermeyer who is nasty and incompetent; Drill Sergeant Nasty who is either competent or incompetent as the plot directs.

Not only was \"Son of Y\" basically your surname in ancient times, but Patronymic surnames are also where many modern last names come from (\"Jacobson,\" \"MacDonald,\" \"Alexeyev,\" \"Ivanovich,\" \"bin Tariq\" and \"Gonz√°lez\", for example).\nThis is exceptionally true amongst Proud Warrior Race Guy societies in Real Life, such as the Samurai of Japan and the Knights of Europe, who by custom formally stated their names followed by father, clan and lineage out of respect for the foes before battling to the death.\nExpect any Proud Warrior Race Guy (or Gal) who enacts this trope to be The Stoic and admirably honorable person who is loyal to the traditions of his or her culture. They might even be the Heir to the Throne of said culture.\nAn increasingly common Variant B is a character who bears the name of his father and culture as a badge of pride, despite being an outcast from said culture. Bastards and children of (often wrongfully) dishonored parents are of this variant.\nNote that My Name Is Inigo Montoya is almost always crossed with this trope, as one would more often than not want the subject of his vengeance to quake in terror knowing just whom they have wronged and who is about to take their lives." }

If this civilization used to be important in the power balance between civilizations that still remain, it's now considered missing.\nThis might mean that they're the last survivor of a particular society or secret order, but for full effect they are actually the last of an entire civilization, or even biological species.\nSuch a character is liable to manifest some profound Survivor Guilt, and the prospect of avenging their kind may develop into an obsession that acts as an Achilles' Heel. It will also provide an excuse for them to be substantially different (read: \"better\") in skill, abilities, or morality than the rest of the characters. However, the writers still need to be careful as to how they construct this Survivor Guilt: owing to Angst Dissonance, even something as traumatic as this can still degenerate into Wangst if the character seems determined not to get over it and eventually move on, or if the character's pain is written in an unconvincing fashion.\nWill often manifest qualities of the Warrior Poet or the Stranger in a Strange Land.\nSince this kind of loneliness is the sort of thing that could easily drive you mad, evil versions are about as common as good ones, particularly of the Nietzsche Wannabe strain. In general, being the last of one's kind is a polarizing experience: the only folks who tend to survive the death of their species are either the very best examples, or the very worst. The evil version will often carry a thematic notion that their very existence is an affront to the natural order, as they \"ought\" to have died with the rest of their kind, and it's rather rude of them to keep hanging on to life well past their time. Some really evil versions might even be responsible for the deaths of the rest of their race in a way (see Lobo below), as may The Atoner every once in a blue moon (see Tetrax, further below). In either case, if it was an engineered genocide, it just backfired.\nVery often, at least for the heroic sort, it will eventually be revealed that There Is Another.\nIt is fairly uncommon for such a character to be the lead character, even if they are an important member of the regular cast. Perhaps that level of isolation is just too much for the audience to really wrap their minds around \u2014 with most characters who are cut off from their own kind, there is at least the prospect of an eventual reunion. This character lacks even that prospect. However, a common Aesop (for the heroic ones at least) they learn is that, even if their race is gone, they aren't truly alone, having people with them who still love and care for them.\nCompare Fling a Light into the Future, Humanity's Wake, Uniqueness Value, and Living Relic. Genocide Backfire and Genocide from the Inside can both cause this trope. Endangered Species and Dying Race are not as extreme versions. Sometimes paired with The Aloner for truly horrifying angst. Occasionally Played for Drama or Played for Laughs with Only You Can Repopulate My Race. Occasionally the Last Of His Kind is of a previously extant Barbarian Tribe of some kind. If There Is Another, see Adam and Eve Plot. The Collector likely wants to put him in their Fantastic Nature Reserve.\nIf there was only ever one member of a species, see Single Specimen Species. Not to be confused with A Kind of One.\nNote that the very last of any species is called an endling.\nContrast with Monster Progenitor and The Chosen Many. Compare Racial Remnant.

Almost always a Special Guest, and often a Large Ham as well. When it's a recurring character, usually a controlling parent.\nA Fawlty Towers Plot will often ensue as our hero tries increasingly more convoluted schemes to convince the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy of his worth.\nIn the end, one of two things happens. Rarely, the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy will turn out to have some kind of massive character flaw, and our hero will realize that it's been a mistake to weight his opinion so highly. This may result in the betrayed hero Calling the Old Man Out. Most of the time, though, everything comes to a head when the \"Well Done, Son\" Guy finally asks the hero why he's gone to such ridiculous ends. The hero fesses up, and the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy explains that he's respected the hero all along, and assumed the hero already knew (You Didn't Ask). If the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy is the hero's friend instead of his father, he'll often also explain that he'd always desperately wanted the respect of the hero as well (hell, sometimes the father wanted the kid's respect, especially if there's something big and nasty in his past, probably either ignored by or unknown to the hero).\nCue the Full House Music.\nIn other genres, this can be a bit more understated, with the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy simply giving our hero an approving nod from a distance (or saying, \"That'll do, pig\"). If the \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy is a Trickster Mentor or Zen Survivor, they may have a very long and painful road ahead of them to get even that. May be part of an Inadequate Inheritor plot.

This allows the station or network to fill up extra space on the schedule with a known quantity, while (in theory) stretching its demographic to female viewers. This method is very popular among action-adventure series, which mostly appeal to young males. However, sometimes it can lead to a Counterpart Comparison situation.\nWhile heroes are usually the ones to get this kind of treatment, it's been happening more and more to villains too.\nThey're also the third kind of Spin-Off, with a long-lost sister showing up or a new girlfriend brought in, only to repeat whatever circumstances gave the main character his powers/duties/what-have-you.\nJust like how many female characters are defined by their relationship to the default or already established male character, many distaff counterparts are defined primarily by their relationship to the male counterpart. This can be shown through their visual properties, narrative connection, and occasionally promotional materials. They are often a wife or girlfriend, but can be a sister or friend to the male counterpart. Often, and especially if the characters in question are animals, the female character will have a bow on her head or other Tertiary Sexual Characteristic defining her as female and to set her apart from the \"default\" male characters. In other words, the male character or characters may have little or no stereotypical masculinizing gender specifiers, but his or their distaff counterpart or counterparts will have stereotypical feminizing gender specifiers to mark them as female. If the distaff counterpart is a girlfriend, she is usually the Love Interest to the male character.\nA male character who goes through the Gender Bender will find himself turned into his own Distaff Counterpart. The implications for the character, writers, and audience are left as an exercise for the reader.\nNOTE: \"Distaff\" means \"female\". Therefore, the inverse of this (a male counterpart to an existing female character or Always Female trope) is technically and traditionally a Spear Counterpart (which was named for the spearhead-shaped end of the symbol of Mars that represents males. You may also be thinking the \"spear\" meant something else).\nSECOND NOTE: A \"distaff\" is a spinning device, used with a spinning wheel and, even before that, with a spindle. More here. Textile Work Is Feminine; that's why it's used to symbolize femininity.\nUsually tends to wear a Gendered Outfit.\nCompare Gender Flip, which reverses roles based on gender, rather than cloning them.

However, it's not uncommon for Those Two Guys to also become popular and even iconic characters in the series.\nTheir personalities usually sharply contrast, e.g. calm/hyper, jock/geek, etc., or their appearances contrast, e.g. short/tall, thin/fat... When they don't, they will be exactly the same. They might even wear Coordinated Clothes. Their names are often esoteric (either too complex or too simple to stand out), plus their non-involvement with the plot usually results in them being called \"Those Two Guys\".\nOccasionally, we get a Lower Deck Episode from their point of view. Expect to ask someone Who Is This Guy Again? after a few episodes.\nCompare the Beta Couple, Heterosexual Life-Partners, Tomboy and Girly Girl, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, Straight Man and Wise Guy, Statler and Waldorf and The Dividual. This trope may sometimes overlap with Red Oni, Blue Oni trope (though that trope isn't always exclusive to the Those Two Guys trope). Despite the similar name, Those Two Bad Guys have very different personalities from Those Two Guys... even if they are bad guys. If there's only one of these guys in a romance-based series, he's likely a Bromantic Foil. Also associated to members of a musical group who are not the Face of the Band." }

One classic tactic used in this variation is a bogus order to one of the heroes to kill the other, bellowed over a loudspeaker. Another is convincing one or both heroes ahead of time that the other either is a villain or has done something horrible.\nThis trope is particularly overused in Super Hero comics and the movies and shows spawned from them.

They are usually incredibly and unflinchingly loyal, and often they are the largest member and even more effective in combat than anyone else. (Sometimes combined.) They will often be the point man, they cause a disturbance and hold off the mooks while the others challenge the Big Bad. Of course, against stronger enemies they might end up suffering The Worf Effect; getting trounced to set up the villain as a credible threat.\nUsually what holds them back from leadership is being Dumb Muscle, they know how to knock heads together but don't do much in the way of strategy. While The Leader and The Lancer fight side-by-side, The Big Guy is a One-Man Army.\nNote: The Big Guy may not necessarily be the strongest in the team. They just have to be the one who, out of most duties, specializes in physical fighting.\nThe Big Guy on the Five-Man Band can be subdivided into five classes:\n Class 1: The gruff, mean, scarred and withdrawn warrior. Could go so far as to be a Berserker, particularly of the Death Seeker variety. In an entire Five-Man Band of ass-kickers, their big guy is most likely be a class 1, ready to punch you in the face for smiling at him.\n Class 2: The Gentle Giant who you don't want to push too far. Often when the other members are younger, he will be older and outside of battle is the calming element in the group, offering both experience and wisdom, or just able to pull two others apart easily.\n Class 3: The kind that looks like the first but is secretly the second.\n Class 4: The Boisterous Bruiser, whose presence is larger than his physical size. Often a Berserker of the Blood Knight variety, or an Emotional Bruiser.\n Class 5: A Genius Bruiser who can also fill the role of The Smart Guy. This character is rare, (presumably also for balance reasons) as The Smart Guy is traditionally unimposing and the Non-Action Guy. This version uses their muscle intelligently, the polar opposite of the Dumb Muscle. Occasionally overlaps with Robot Buddy.\nPowers and skills common to the big guy are:\n The Big Guy will often be the band's \"tank\" or Stone Wall; a Mighty Glacier who serves as the strongest physical fighter, but also the slowest and least proficient at magic. Alternatively, he's just a Stone Wall. The lucky ones are those who are as fast they are strong.\n Most Big Guys tend to prefer big, heavy weapons like axes or hammers (or oversized guns like bazookas or chainguns if in a modern/futuristic setting).\n Others are powerful martial artists who clobber the bad guys with their bare hands.\n If it's a magical setting, they may also be adept at Dishing Out Dirt or have a Green Thumb, as the \"earth\" element can be seen as tough, strong, and/or sturdy. Alternatively Ice may have similar connotations.\nThis bandmate is rarely a woman, unless the whole team is women. The Big Girl can be classified into three subspecies:\n The Cute Bruiser: she who packs a surprising amount of punch. Traditionally a little girl, but can be stretched to any woman who is not obviously of amazonian stature. May be a martial artist or some other form of athlete. In cases of truly great strength, she may be a cyborg, Robot Girl, mutant, alien, possess Charles Atlas Superpower, or have some other justification for unusual power. Usually just as cute and/or pretty as more typical female characters. Male versions of the cute bruiser exist too.\n Alternatively and more unusually, she's a Giantess, and thus plainly strong. She's rarely masculine but rarely conventionally attractive. (There's also nothing stopping her from being a robot, mutant, alien, etc. It's just that the surprise is gone.)\n Somewhat more rare is the Amazon: She's big, she's strong, she's muscular, and drooled over by men. (Sometimes Even the Girls Want Her). On the romance level, she often either is admired AND feared because of her strength or only be willing to yield to a really powerful male who is able to beat her in battle.\nWhen there are Two Girls to a Team, the Big Girl and The Chick commonly form a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair. Most of the time, the Big Girl is the tomboy and the Chick is the girly girl. However, there is nothing preventing the Big Girl from being more of a Girly Bruiser or Lady of War, or a tomboy from being The Heart of the team.\nAn exuberant Big Girl is either a Boisterous Bruiser or Genki Girl. If she's instead a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, her softer side is often a secret cache of feminine traits or one particularly girlish habit, which may make her embarrassed when found out. On rare occasions, she may be revealed to be a Butch Lesbian, a Tsundere, or even a Violently Protective Girlfriend.\nBesides gender, the most common way to subvert the trope is when the Big Guy is actually physically short, slim, or unimposing - and yet his strength comes with raw determination or intensity. (Or possibly supernatural means)\nThe Five-Bad Band's Evil Counterpart is The Brute. Not to be confused with that other Big Guy.\nCan have some overlap with Scary Black Man and the Proud Warrior Race Guy. Often a victim of Big Guy Fatality Syndrome." }

They're friendly, psychologically well-balanced, morally average (if not better) and in short, someone anyone wouldn't mind to be around and have as a friend, which is often what they are to the hero and/or his extended cast. He won't engage in jerk-like behavior, but probably responds in kind to Vitriolic Best Buds.\nWant to know what writers think of that? \"Boring!\". This is because they can be conflict null zones romantically and dramatically because of a perceived (or real) lack of depth. Along with the Happily Married couple, the Nice Guy is among fiction's \"favorite\" Friendly Targets. They'll die senselessly to motivate their hero buddy, lose the girl to the more dynamic but unstable Dogged Nice Guy or just in general go through constant torment from the world around them.\nOn the other hand, if done right, it can demonstrate why a guy has beautiful women attached to him: he really is a remarkably wonderful and compassionate person. The Nice Guy can be engaging, likable or The Protagonist; all it takes is giving them a personality outside of \"nice\" such as: a scholarly refinement, a chivalric attitude, some engaging relationships, and a pinch of Hidden Depths.\nNor does it mean being nice means they're not tough, or an Iron Woobie. If combat intellect or combat ability are involved, it's akin to Obfuscating Stupidity or Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass because you naturally expect the dark, tormented loner to be rough and tough, and the nice guy to be a Non-Action Guy. So when it comes time for \"No more Mr. Nice Guy\", heads roll. On the other hand, with the All of the Other Reindeer trope in play, the nice fellow can be a redeeming factor as a person whom the beleaguered hero realizes is on his side and lets him know he's not alone. Unless the nice guy is the beleaguered hero, then he's screwed.\nOften, authors go the abbreviated route and give them a Dark and Troubled Past triggered by a Berserk Button. Either way, you can expect their niceness to be in spite of whatever tragedy or drama is in their lives; kind of an equal and opposite reaction to it. If done too suddenly, it implies a level of secrecy and acting that a Stepford Smiler would be jealous of. When done well, a more troubled character will rebuff their advice or friendship with \"What do you know? You've never had X happen to you!\" to his \"I did\", thus revealing healed-over scars.\nNote: this trope is referring to genuine Nice Guys, not the other sort of \"Nice Guy\" (aka the Dogged Nice Guy), which is more of a Bastard in Sheep's Clothing (usually with major Casanova Wannabe tendencies). Entitled to Have You is the trope for that concept. Also, if the Nice Guy has a rougher male as his Foil, they're a Noble Male, Roguish Male or Sensitive Guy and Manly Man duo.\nOccasionally, however, the treatment go the other way around: Perhaps in a world set upon Black and Grey Morality, and Gray and Grey Morality, this Nice Guy actually stands out because he IS a Nice Guy, he doesn't have the excuse to be cynical or mean, nor does he need to have a tragic backstory. He's that nice, friendly and helpful... that he eventually becomes a fan-favorite due to how much he stands out amongst the more cynical cast members, a refreshing breeze to say.\nIf he does get the girl, it's Single Woman Seeks Good Man. Usually, the result of Upbringing Makes the Hero. You should beware this nice guy should you press his Berserk Button. Exact oppositions of this trope are: Jerkass, Lack of Empathy, Jerk with a Heart of Jerk and the Complete Monster (extreme opposition)." }

This is in the form of Male Gaze, usually with slow pans up her legs, or her legs are mentioned at some point in the story as being an attractive feature.

Whatever the case may be, now one's the hero and one's the villain, and they must do battle. Commence the angst.\nFor whatever reason, the older sibling is almost always the villainous one. Probably because being younger and less experienced makes the younger sibling the underdog, whom we are supposed to root for. And because the Aloof Big Brother always looks eviler. The major exception is the case of The Evil Prince, who is usually the younger of two princes, and who will do anything to make sure he succeeds their father instead of his brother (or in the case of the prince being the king's brother, to take the throne for himself directly).\nIt's not always siblings \u2014 Childhood Friends get to experience all the same woes from beating up someone they grew up with \u2014 but there's a certain poetry when they're actually related.

The reasons vary, maybe they have inherited a form of Enemy Within capable of a truly Unstoppable Rage that can destroy worlds, or have been possessed by an Eldritch Abomination, or most heart wrenchingly they are completely innocent yet their mere existence acts as a Butterfly of Doom that can destroy the Cosmic Keystone. Either way, they're going to somehow bring about the apocalypse in some form Because Destiny Says So.\nNeedless to say, the villains (and certain heroes) who realize this want to nip this in the bud by killing said Chosen One. Of course, seeing as that person is one of their True Companions (usually a Love Interest), the heroes say Screw Destiny and try to protect the chosen one from others and potentially, even themselves. Then again, some villains (and certain heroes) may well want them to destroy the world, and kidnap them in order to brainwash or sacrifice them in a manner that kick starts the apocalypse. In which case the heroes have to find a way to stop the world ending and save their friend... and both may be mutually exclusive.\nSadly, because You Can't Fight Fate these attempts to prevent the cataclysm may become self-fulfilling because Prophecies Are Always Right (in such a case, its a Downer Ending). Optimistically, their friend's efforts and The Power Of Trust may embolden them to become an Anti Anti Christ and successfully rebel against their destiny... even if it requires the ultimate sacrifice.\nProphetic Fallacy may also be a cause for the villain's alarm, or maybe The Powers That Be were merciful.\nThis is more of a plot than a character (it could be either).

One of the most common methods of execution back in the medieval era next to hanging, decapitation is usually one of the surest ways to ensure someone is Deader than Dead barring some very potent magic or divine intervention. Indeed, in Real Life, it is one of the very few ways that death can be instantly diagnosed.\nAny Ridiculously Human Robot (even one with a Cranial Processing Unit) or other decidedly inhuman being will probably be capable of surviving decapitation, and will do so at some point either for a joke or as a plot point. In less serious series, the body will even continue to walk around bumping into things.\nIt is nearly always depicted as being surprisingly easy to do, even in one blow to a moving target. While Anne Boleyn did get beheaded with one stroke, most pre-guillotine beheadings took at least three strokes (plus, Boleyn's executioner was \u2014 by request \u2014 a professional swordsman who would know how to cleanly behead someone). In an actual Sword Fight a strike on the head was much more common, since it didn't put your sword at a very awkward angle and required much less force.\nThis trope is named after the line Off with his head; \u2014 so much for Buckingham from Colley Cibber's adaptation of Richard III. The trope was also famously used by the Queen of Hearts in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. See also Your Head A Splode for a much gorier version of this trope and Boom, Headshot when it comes to firearms.\nAlso see Alas, Poor Yorick, Decapitation Presentation and Severed Head Sports. When cutting of the head is the only way to kill something, it's Decapitation Required. If the decapitated head is somehow still alive after the fact for any notable length of time, that's Losing Your Head.\nAs per being a death trope, EXPECT UNMARKED SPOILERS!!!" }

The problem lies in that they are too timid, half hearted, Weak-Willed or kind to avoid their Extreme Doormat tendencies, much less actually learn to fight.\nThe solution is to teach him or her anger and rage; rather than dealing with their anger in a healthy way (or more likely, sublimating it) instead channel it into their words and fists. In extreme cases, even going so far as to instill a killer instinct.\nThis can have two outcomes, one good and one bad.\nThe good outcome results in the character taking a level in badass and gaining a backbone along with the combat skills thanks to this training, which may take the form of anything from simple self defense classes to outright maddening them into misanthropy. Their nature and demeanor as a kind/caring/friendly person will otherwise remain unchanged, but now they'll stand up for themselves and the weak rather than simply caring for them.\nThe bad outcome happens when they learn anger only too well. In some cases, these kind and caring pacifists subconsciously knew they were carefully balanced over a dormant volcano of potential violence and chose to keep it dormant at all costs. And then their friends went and woke it up. If Phlebotinum is involved then it is likely paired with An Aesop against changing others to suit you...because they'll turn into Brainwashed and Crazy dynamos of destruction who revel in their new Superpowered Evil Side.

He rarely gets the funny lines, but has to have impeccable timing and delivery so that the comic (the other half of a comedy duo) can hit it out of the park. Bud Abbott (widely considered the greatest Straight Man of all time) had to say \"Who's on First?\" with just the right degree of earnestness and irritation so that Lou Costello could get big laughs saying \"Whaddya askin' me for?\"\nThe best Straight Men are so good they can sometimes get laughs just by delivering a straight line so well the audience knows what's coming. (This is essentially the basis of Bob Newhart's \"telephone\" routines: he was playing the Straight Man to nothing.) Other straight men in comedy duos have included George Burns (with Gracie Allen), Dean Martin (with Jerry Lewis), and Dan Rowan (with Dick Martin of Laugh-In).\nIn less-comedic works, the Straight Man is a Foil for the Bunny-Ears Lawyer, Magnificent Bastard or Loveable Rogue.\nIf the Straight Man is the lead in an ensemble like a Power Trio or Five-Man Band or even a show with Loads and Loads of Characters, this can lead to them suffering Designated Protagonist Syndrome by being overshadowed by the rest of the cast who get more interesting plot roles and character development (see also Standardised Leader).\nThe term can apply to women, but \"comedic foil\" is a more popular unisex term. In fact women in comic pairings have frequently played this role over the last few decades usually with Women Are Wiser coming into play.\nIn TV comedy, a Straight Man is frequently one half of an Odd Couple. In a Power Trio, they usually play the \"helpless observer\" role.\nIf you're looking for the trope for \"the only sensible character\", you probably want Only Sane Man; the two tropes can and often do overlap, and it's pretty rare to have one of each, but the Straight Man and the Only Sane Man are not automatically the same character. See also The Comically Serious, Straight Man and Wise Guy. Also Deadpan Snarker, which quite a few comedic foils are. If multiple characters take turns playing Straight Man, they have a game of Sanity Ball.

Sometimes the child wants to be himself in a career the parent dislikes. And sometimes, the parent struggles with this, but eventually comes around and supports his child.\nAnd sometimes he doesn't. And if the child (usually a son) doesn't step into line quickly, the offending parent quickly disowns him, disavowing all knowledge that this \"son\" ever even existed.\nCue the sad violin music \u2014 it looks like the kid is going to have to learn to make his own way in this harsh, harsh world all alone.\nThis doesn't mean that reconciliation is impossible further on down the track. But it usually happens years later, when the kid's a success and often when the parent is on their deathbed, and it's a long, bitter road until that happens.\nRest assured, however, that the chances of this happening are far higher than one might expect. The initial I Have No Son sequence typically takes place in flashback \u2014 we only learn the story because the now successful disowned son is giving us a sob story about how much he wishes his father would approve, or at least acknowledge his existence. If we see the event unfold in real time, then usually it gets wrapped up much sooner.\nBear in mind that the parent doing the disowning might not be entirely a jerk; sometimes, the kid just crosses a line they shouldn't cross (especially if they've grown up wrong) and deserves being kicked out with all ties severed. Again, reconciliation isn't an impossibility, but since this kid's bitter and twisted anyway don't expect it happening any time soon. And rest assured that the parent is going to have to justify their actions to the audience explicitly anyway, since the act of disowning one's own flesh and blood for any reason is well, pretty harsh. A justification commonly seen in a Crime and Punishment Series is when the parents essentially disown the child due to a crippling drug habit that the child has plunged into; this is often accompanied with a justification about how \"there's only so long you can watch or enable them to destroy themselves before you have to sever all ties.\"\nThis trope has various roots \u2014 most obvious is the tendency of many writers to be of Jewish descent. Orthodox communities could be particularly unforgiving when it came to children (particularly males) who decided to try and make their way outside of the Jewish community.\nOf course, overuse of this term has caused the words themselves to be considered a Dead Horse Trope, if not the entire plot itself. As a result most modern examples tend to skew toward the side of comedy. When the question is not about comedy but the descendant actually is the culprit, this trope can constitute Know When to Fold 'Em.\nThe Up to Eleven variant of this trope is honor killing, where the parents not only disown the child, but murder him or her.\nSee also: Changeling Fantasy and Where Did We Go Wrong?.

Consequently, when trying to go about your daily grind, you accidentally break almost anything in your hands from pulling or squeezing too hard (that could include other people's hands). Jars and cups burst from the slightest squeeze, you burst through doors and windows, your shoulders chip at entrances/egresses and at worst, you cause severe damage to important facilities or even living beings. The toughest objects are brittle in your super-strong hands and you have to be extra delicate with how you hold or lift things. This is one of the most Omnipresent gags in the medium of superpowers as one of the missing Required Secondary Powers that has to be re-learned and remembered for daily functioning.\nNormally, it only happens to folks who gain Super Strength, not characters born with it and who had it all their life. After all, in real life an Olympic athlete that can lift several times his own weight can also pick up a caterpillar without squishing it and it would create all sorts of Fridge Logic to see a character with long-established super strength and constantly smashing plates or bottles and not wonder how they ever managed to feed themselves without learning how to control their power.\nThis trope is related to Blessed with Suck but is specific to strength and to powers which resemble strength (i.e. the ability to crush objects via telekinesis). It works as a trade-off where the massive raw power that's great for a battle makes Mundane tasks hell to perform. Another variation involves Functional Magic or Psychic Powers, where a mage or telekinetic who could decimate armies with their powers have to do chores by hand, because they lack fine control. After all, when you're incinerating enemies, \"Too much fire\" isn't really a problem. Sometimes leads to Stronger Than They Look.\nIf the hero's family is unaware of his powers, undoubtedly the blame for the damage will fall on 'shoddy construction' or on another house member's bad attempts at DIY.\nA frequent and more realistic variation of this is that the hero is able to control his strength, but when tempers flare or the hero is startled (or otherwise incapacitated, or perhaps inebriated) that control quickly lapses.\nCompare And Call Him George, when it happens to (formerly) living things.

However, like most mythical creatures and monsters, they are a little different every time and have different rules applied to them. Their dispositions, morality, and alliances vary depending on the author, and whether or not they can become human is a question everyone answers differently. Even their general appearance isn't fixed: see the picture.\nAppearance:\nMerfolk are generally portrayed as beautiful women (mermaids) or handsome men (mermen) with fish- or dolphin-like tails in place of legs. Sometimes they are not so pretty, but still fall under the Cute Monster Girl heading. Others are more blatantly sea-creatures with few human characteristics and are quite ugly, for example the Harry Potter merman (mermaid?) pictured. Sometimes they have features reminiscent of other, more exotic seas-creatures, and sometimes they are sea-animals that become human-like under certain circumstances.\nSome joke that merfolk have the fish half on top instead of on the bottom in order to resolve \"the Mermaid Problem\". Mermaids who are more human-looking (and modest) tend to wear Seashell Bras. And then there's underwater folk like Aquaman, Namor the Submariner, The Man From Atlantis etc. who look like normal humans for the most part but can survive and breathe underwater and may have some odd physical adaptations that are well-hidden until they return to the sea. It should also be noted that most mermaids have the \"fish half\" in a cetacean (horizontal fluke) configuration, rather than a fish's vertical configuration, since this is closer to how an actual human swims, though exceptions exist. Of course, cetaceans are terrestrial mammals which have evolved to an aquatic lifestyle, so this is probably fair enough.\nMerperson to Human:\nSometimes merpeople can turn into humans, or vice versa, under certain circumstances. The way this is done and differences in the \"rules\" surrounding this are numerous:\n The Splash Method: The mermaid can become human when they are dry and turn back when wet. Sometimes this is something all merpeople can do, and sometimes there are limits on how long they can do it.\n The Little Mermaid Method: The mermaid invokes a magic spell which allows them to turn human. Sometimes, this is at a hefty cost. In the original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, it's the title's character's tongue; the sea-witch responsible expects payment, and specifies, \"the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught.\". May be combined with the above.\n The Fredericka Bimm Method: Mermaids can switch forms more or less at will. Unlike the Splash method, getting doused with water is not a problem.\n The Magical Item Method: Common in some mythologies but, curiously, not often utilized in modern fiction. The Mermaid has a magical item which allows her to change from one form to another. Some of these items are obvious; a Selkie needs her shed seal-skin to return to her home in the sea. Or a mermaid could pass for human on land in a wheelchair. Others are... kind of random; a Merrow needs a hat made of red feathers to (depending on which variant on the legend you are reading) return to the sea or assume human form.\n And of course, some mermaids don't posess shapeshifting abilities at all \u2014 no matter how much they may want to change, the half-fish appearance is their default, permanent form.\nGood or Evil?:\nSometimes mermaids are portrayed as evil seductresses (sometimes called devil fish) who lure sailors to their deathsnote¬†this is based on the myths of sirens which were originally birdwomen but who are generally portrayed as mermaids these days due to language confusion. In most mythologies, they display the inscrutable and sometimes dangerous amorality of The Fair Folk, especially if mermaids are treated as marine fae. Sometimes they are good but flirty and mischievous. Sometimes they are mostly innocent and naive. Sometimes they are honorable, and of these, several resent us for treating their ocean home so badly for so long. Sometimes (just sometimes) they are just like us and have all sorts of personas. Very often, though not always, they are Tsundere, or even outright Yandere types. Octopus or Squid-based mermaids\u2014sometimes called cilophytes or cecaelia\u2014are usually portrayed as evil, probably owing to the influence of Disney's sea-witch Ursula, or perhaps because of the \"alien\" nature of tentacles.\nOne thing that also tends to vary among depictions of mermaids is their ability to survive on land: some depictions show them being completely unable to breathe out of water, others show them being able to stay above the surface but needs to be wet to avoid drying out, and some show no qualms at all about leaving the sea and can stay out of water seemingly indefinitely (except for not having legs).\nMost merfolk can communicate with fish and sea creatures, regardless of whether they eat them or not. Expect merfolk to remain naked no matter how deep they swim or how little protection their skin has, though their bodies might have some unseen protection against the cold and high pressure of the depths.\nUnscaled Merfolk is a Sub-Trope, where the non-human parts are not a scaled fish; see also Selkies and Wereseals.\nSee also Mermaid Problem, Shape Shifting Lover, The Fair Folk, Sirens Are Mermaids and Friendly, Playful Dolphin, Heroic Dolphin and Sapient Cetacean.\nMay occasionally overlap with Fish People, though they are generally more of an anthropomorphic fusion than a half-and-half mix." }

One of the reasons for that is a Discredited Trope: the idea that lesbianism was a form of asexuality. It was believed that the average lesbian wasn't actually attracted to women but was instead irrationally afraid of men (and therefore sex in general, because if there isn't a penis involved it isn't sex), usually because she had been hurt by a \"bad guy\". She chose women only because she still required emotional fulfillment, which was thought to be the only thing women wanted out of sex. This trope (and its much darker companion, the idea that a lesbian could be turned straight by a \"good guy\", even if he has to rape her) has been largely forgotten, but echoes still reverberate in many areas.\nPart of the reason that Yaoi Fans and Yuri Fans alike have reputations for pairing up any two guys or gals who interact with each other; most canon couples are reduced to subtext as is, so why not elaborate?\nDo not confuse with But Not Too Gay; that trope is for when there is a confirmed same-gender relationship in the work, but the physical contact between the partners is much more G-rated than the opposite-gender couples.

When asked where he got them, nine times out of ten he will say he Cut Himself Shaving. Likewise, a guy who beat someone up will often say that the victim \"fell down some stairs\" or \"ran into a door\" whenever being questioned by the cops.\nA subversion is the character who really did walk into a door, but everyone assumes they're covering.\nIn anime and manga, this trope is usually just explained by all characters as \"I fell,\" and keeping it unspecific. This leads to wondering by the characters, as by the reader, \"Fell on what?\"\nAlso frequently employed by a Super Hero when he must preserve his Secret Identity by explaining away wounds sustained in battle. It may also be used by someone attempting to cover-up Self Harm or someone being abused at home (in which case \"I fell down the stairs\" is a common phrase).\nAnother variant, found in military fiction and military science fiction, has two men - often an officer and an NCO - engage in a brawl in a nice, quiet, out-of-the-way spot to settle some point of honor, with the unspoken agreement being that each will cover for the other's injuries (frequently by claiming to have been practicing hand-to-hand combat techniques.)

The stranger will typically either respond, \"Oh, I know him well...\" or else act as if he's never heard of the person. Either way, in time it is revealed that this stranger is the sought-after character.\nOften, the stranger is playing dumb about their true identity in order to assess the searcher's character and intentions, the idea being that the searcher's behavior will be more genuine in the presence of someone they perceive to be just an ordinary stranger. This can lead to a painful lesson for the searcher once he learns the truth about the stranger, making this a favorite form of introduction among Trickster Mentors.\nIt still satisfies this trope if the person tells the searcher straight-out, without pussyfooting around or playing games, who he is, as in the opening Star Wars quote.\nFurther confusion can arise if the sought-after character is of a different gender, race, species, etc. than the searcher was expecting, such as when a sought-after \"doctor\" turns out to be a woman scientist. Or maybe the searcher was just Expecting Someone Taller.\nCan also be Luke, I Am Your Father if the sought-after character is the searcher's parent.

Even though the detectives pass them over at first, you just know that they're going to be important in the episode, because they wouldn't have paid to cast a well-known actor in a throwaway role. It is very common that the most recognizable actor is the guilty party.\nSometimes you can narrow it down before the show actually airs due to the commercials for an upcoming episode playing up the guest star.\nThis can become self-subverting when watching reruns; someone high-profile now might've just been starting out when they appeared on the show. (Harrison Ford has said that, early in his career, he spent a lot of time playing \"the guy that didn't do it\".)\nThis can also happen in films. If a high-profile actor is playing a supposedly minor role (after becoming high-profile), keep a close eye on this person. Compare One-Scene Wonder, Contractual Immortality. Some better-funded productions seek to subvert this by making all of the suspects well known actors, so you only know that one of them did it.

This kind of thing really cuts into spending quality time with the kid he wanted so much a few episodes ago, and can make him question how selfish he might be being.\nThere's also the inherent issue of him being a complete and total danger magnet. All those psychotic bad guys who, by virtue of existing and hating the hero, nearly destroyed the hero's love life (and perhaps continue causing dangerous hiccups in the hero's attempts at normalcy) are still out there, and couldn't care less that there's a baby in the picture now.

These are scary because of how they personify the fears of buying a new house: that your house has some hideous aspect that you haven't seen, but can see you.\nThis trope is named for the landmark work of feminist literary criticism by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, referring to Mr. Rochester's wife in Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre.

He may travel a lot and wow the kids with stories of meeting celebrities and traveling the world (and if so, he always brings back the coolest souvenirs, which he naturally gives away as presents). Or he may be well-off and spoils his sibling's kids whenever they're together.\nRegardless, he will often be secretly be envious of the stability and loving home life that his brother or sister enjoys, even as he boasts of his own independence. The uncle may be the Black Sheep of the family. If his nieces and nephews ever lose their parent, he's the one who usually steps in to become a Parental Substitute.\nThis trope is usually male, but the role will occasionally be taken on by an aunt.\nContrast Evil Uncle and Creepy Uncle." }

He might be slow, but he sure is strong \u2014 he doesn't seem to even notice the hero's blows. The hero can hold him off for a while, but before too long, the mook has knocked away his weapon and taken hold of him. With this enemy's strength, this is surely the end for our hero. He'll just snap the hero like a twig, crush the life out of him, or hold him still with one hand and punch his head right off his shoulders...\nOh, no, he's thrown the hero across the room. I'm sure it hurt, but the hero is getting up again. Now he's very slowly closing the distance... He's got the hero again; now it's time for the killing blow. Just twist his head off like a bottle cap....\nNope, he's just holding the hero up in the air by the throat. Oh, and now the hero has kicked him in the groin. You'd think the mook would have seen that coming. However, unfazed, he...\n...he's thrown the hero again \u2014 right through a wall, so he must have thrown him pretty hard. However, the hero is now conveniently right next to the weapon he dropped earlier, giving him another chance to fight back. This could have been avoided if the mook would have Just Hit Him!\nAlso popular with superpowered villains with telekinetic powers. Despite the availability of superior attacks, they always try to lift the hero up in the air and toss him gently.\nA Doylist explanation for this phenomenon is that many writers are not martial artists. While the Gracies demonstrated the power of Brazilian jui-jitsu over many striking styles in the early days of the UFC, grappling and wrestling are still widely underestimated by the public, who don't recognize the damage a good slam or throw can do.\nThe other Doylist explanation arises when the mook is specifically superstrong. Any superstrong character who gets his hands on a normal human just needs to squeeze. The human will then be dead (or crippled and in agonizing pain, depending on the part that got squeezed). This would end the fight fast and permanently, and that is sometimes exactly what the story doesn't need.\nSee Why Don't Ya Just Shoot Him? for relevant Stock Phrases. Compare Bond Villain Stupidity. Contrast Wrestler in All of Us, particularly its subtropes Meteor Move, Spinning Piledriver and Suplex Finisher, where throws are genuinely dangerous.\n\nExamples" }

Sometimes, though, the villain just doesn't want to fight. Maybe they just finished a hero/villain teamup. Maybe they're in a neutral zone, and they can't be overtly hostile. Or maybe the evil one is just Genre Savvy enough to realize that sometimes the best way to hit somebody is to trick them into crawling down to evil's level.\nThis trope is what happens when a villain starts annoying the hero as much as possible without actually giving them any clear cause to resort to violence. Once placed in this situation, the hero has two options. First, give in. After that, punishment is inevitable. Whenever an evil character manages to provoke a good character in this manner, the good one always ends up getting punished. This is almost always what the evil character intended by being such a pest in the first place.\nThe second choice, and always the one taken by especially noble heroes who make it a point to be Lawful Good, is to walk away and not dignify the evil ones with the satisfaction of manipulating a good guy.\nNaturally, this trope can tend to be a pretty heavy Broken Aesop- the Na√Øve Everygirl must forgive and understand and offer her friendship to the Alpha Bitch no matter how badly and rudely and unfairly she's treated... but don't expect anybody to cut you a break, ever. The number of times main characters must learn to accept jerks and devils in plain sight because \"it's the right thing to do\" is exactly proportionate to the number of times they can't get away with similar infractions.\nThis trope stems from the fact that the main character Can't Get Away with Nuthin' . When anyone can taunt anyone else, but the main character is evil for doing so, it's Selective Enforcement.\nA character's response to this trope is a good way of determining where they fall on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism. See If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him for this trope as it applies to a Matter of Life and Death.\nSee I Shall Taunt You when this scheme is employed deliberately as a part of a larger plan, usually a Batman Gambit." }
