Whether she's The Cutie, an Action Girl, a Magical Girl, leader of La Résistance, or whatever you can think of, there's one very strong possibility: she's royalty; specifically, a princess.\nAfter years of exposure to the classical princess we have this interpretation that princesses have it easy. They don't have to work (that's their parents' job!), they get everything they want (money and power go a long way) and, in girls' series, they have very marketable wardrobes (blame the Ermine Cape Effect).\nUsually, if she's got powers, she's The Chosen One, and it's all because of her lineage. Her sheltered life has left her ill-prepared to cope with real adversity, so don't expect her to be much of a hero. She'll likely be the White Magician Girl at best. This is usually true even if she grew up in a normal family to hide from her enemies \u2014 perhaps frailty is in the blood.\nAny Kingdom worth the name has a princess. If that's the case, expect a violent conflict with her Aloof Big Brother, The Evil Prince, and/or the Evil Chancellor.\nBy the way do not expect princes to be given anything like the same sympathy as their sisters (more so in modern works). They are very often either outright bad or well meaning but stupid.\nNote that you rarely see any minor nobles as lead female characters, nor any young queens. If she's a royal, she's the princess. Her sketchy genetic makeup will be avoided altogether, and you won't see a single Habsburg chin around. Though in real life, princesses can be any age, princesses in fiction are usually children or teenagers, and are almost never older than 25, let alone middle-aged or elderly.\nIf she's surprisingly good in a fight despite her sheltered upbringing, it might be because Authority Equals Asskicking.\nOftentimes, she is the 100% ruler of a region. This is sometimes justified by the region in question being a principality rather than a kingdom.\nSomething of a Dead Horse Trope due to literally centuries of overuse, and having become firmly recognised as a Common Mary Sue Trait. Despite this, due to the Grandfather Clause, teenage girls, and how easy it is to parody, plenty of princesses will appear in the pages yet to come.\nA Super Trope to Princess Classic.\n\nExamples" }

Instead of knitting or gossiping, this princess has developed powers or abilities that make her more like a cactus than a delicate flower.\nInstead of the Damsel in Distress, this princess's role in the plot is active. She still might fall in love with the hero, as a princess traditionally would, but she'll be fighting next to him instead of crying for help. She could be his sidekick or he could be her sidekick; either way she won't be sitting around waiting for someone else to end the fight.\nThis trope is a popular choice for writers/readers sick of the passive Princess Classic. This could be because they've seen it too often, find it sexist, both or neither.\nHer outfits will also vary, ranging from a simple frock, to a Minidress of Power, Battle Ballgown or even a Pimped-Out Dress.\nWhile this and the Rebellious Princess sometimes go hand in hand, they do not equal each other. In fact, a badass princess would often fight because she's loyal to her nation, and would fight to defend it at any cost. Every Badass Princess qualifies as an automatic Royal Who Actually Does Something. If she's kid friendly she'll often (but not always) be a Tomboy Princess. She might be a Lady of War with an elegant weapon or more of an Action Girl who will get her hands dirty, or she might even switch back and forth. An evil Badass Princess (with an equally evil father) will probably be Daddy's Little Villain, and will only get worse if she manages to inherit the throne. Unfortunately, especially thanks to its prevalence in bad fanfiction, some people automatically see this character as a Mary Sue.\nCompare Damsel out of Distress, Warrior Prince, Silk Hiding Steel, Tomboy Princess, Kicking Ass in All Her Finery.\nContrast Princess Classic, Faux Action Girl." }

If not an actual Badass Princess, she tends to be otherwise highly placed, or at least look and act like it. If she's not gentle-mannered she may be an Aloof Dark-Haired Girl or arrogant and generally prissy and might become subject to a Defrosting Ice Queen scenario. Often, she's simply The Stoic.\nIn RPGs, female roles tend to be limited to magic use, but sometimes women get to take on more physical roles in combat, and that leads us to a different Odd Couple pair: the Lady of War and the Cute Bruiser.\nCharacter-design wise, she doesn't tend to be held up as a sex symbol the way most female warriors are, or at least not quite so obviously. The Lady of War does have her own charm in a cool, collected, Nicole Kidman way. She's also very unlikely to be paired with the protagonist \u2014 that's what White Mages are for \u2014 unless there is no White Mage. In any case, she almost certainly occupies a firm place in the hearts of at least a minority of the fandom. (see Amazon Chaser)\nA Lady of War is almost always given an elegant weapon that emphasizes her femininity \u2014 often a bow, rapier or naginata, all weapons that have a certain choreographic element in the way they're wielded. They also allow her to avoid getting her hands dirty and usually invoke Wouldn't Hit a Girl as a result. If guns are the norm, she's likely to prefer an easily-concealed revolver with deadly aim, as opposed to an automatic. If the story deals with martial arts, she'll use a \"refined\" fighting style like Tai Chi or Aikijutsu, or will be given the gymnastic prowess to engage in some variant of She-Fu.\nAlso expect her Impossibly Cool Clothes to still reflect her position. She might even wear a Battle Ballgown.\nIn terms of physical capabilities, she's usually some form of the Fragile Speedster (or Glass Cannon, if a ranged fighter), but it's not unheard of for her to be a Jack of All Stats or Mighty Glacier/Glacier Waif, especially if she wears armor.\nIf she were a preteen, she'd be a Little Miss Badass.\nContrasted by Short Tank or Bokukko Cute Bruisers. Where the Lady of War is about grace and reserve, the tomboyish Cute Bruiser is more about unrestrained passion and power. The former also tends to be older than the latter. There is the possibility of having the Cute Bruiser grow up into a Lady of War, but it's not that common. See also Girly Bruiser.\nPretty much anyone with the title \"Lady\" in an Action Adventure story will be this.\nCompare Royals Who Actually Do Something, Rebellious Princess, Badass Princess, Kicking Ass in All Her Finery and Officer and a Gentleman. Contrast Princess Classic, Prince Charming. Compare/Contrast Modest Royalty. If she's based on Joan of Arc, she's a Jeanne d'Archétype. Compare Silk Hiding Steel, for a woman who does her fighting in the court or parlor and with a fan and words instead of spear and shield.\nA subtrope of Action Girl, though not all Action Girls qualify as Ladies of War if they lack the calm, dignified demeanor. Essentially, she's the Distaff Counterpart to an Officer and a Gentleman. A Lady of War who uses magic rather than a melee weapon is a Lady of Black Magic. May be the female half of a Battle Couple. Like a male Cultured Warrior, some incarnations have a chance of being developed into a Warrior Poet.\nPlease list examples in alphabetical order.\n\nExamples" }

Damsel in Distress? Not this time. She doesn't sit around waiting to be rescued. She's headbutting her jailer and breaking herself out, if they even manage to kidnap her in the first place. She proves, with her very being, that girls aren't only not helpless, they're strong. But not just \"any girl with a fight scene\" can be considered an Action Girl. An Action Girl is usually Badass, and routinely and reliably gets in on the combat. And what's more, she wins.\nBecause of Double Standards, and their effects on Real Life society most works draw on, true Action Girls are less common than male Badasses. If you want to get more into the why of that, check out the Gender Dynamics Index or our very own Action Girl Analysis page. The short version however, is the concept that Men Are Strong, Women Are Pretty and females should Stay in the Kitchen. For a very long time, females who did something outside of waiting to be rescued by men were unusual and rare. Even now, women aren't automatically assumed to be able to fight and protect themselves the way men are. Society has progressed since then and Action Girls are popular and more common than ever, but girls still haven't completely caught up with boys when it comes to expectations in media, hence the continued existence of this trope.\nThat being said, one must watch out for the dreaded Faux Action Girl. With the popularity of the Action Girl increasing, creators are trying to slip them in for more appeal without actually giving them a chance to show themselves off. The \"Action\" part of the character is left as an Informed Attribute, with characters constantly playing up how much of a badass she is, and yet when it comes to facing the music, she proves otherwise by being a Damsel in Distress or suffering the effects of being on the wrong end of a Curb-Stomp Battle, assuming she gets any action at all. Basically she can talk the talk, but she can't walk the walk. Oh, and if she's on the right end of a Curb-Stomp Battle, she's a Dark Action Girl.\nSometimes an Action Girl can start off well, but derail into a Faux Action Girl or a full-on Damsel in Distress over time, with no adequate justification for it. This is known as Chickification.\nWhen the Action Girl is mixed with the Smurfette Principle trope, she is called a \"minority feisty.\"\nCompare the Action Girl with her Evil Counterpart, the often far-more-aggressive Dark Action Girl, and the more mundane versions You Go Girl and Plucky Girl. Not to be confused with Affirmative Action Girl, who is just a girl added to the cast in an adaptation or new season to balance out the gender ratio, no matter what role she actually plays (though, often, the girl is an Action Girl herself).\nNot to be confused with Action Girl, a comic series about an action girl." }

Usually, it's where the daughter utterly adores the father-figure and at times the mother (if there is one) feels completely left out. The daughter, who is usually, but not always, either a single child or the only girl in the family, is likewise the father's favorite. In extreme instances, this can all be part of Wife Husbandry or can result in the daughter becoming obsessed with her father to the point of developing an Electra Complex.\nDue to their close contact to the male parent, Daddys' Girls can sometimes acquire boyish traits and interests at odds with expected female personality types like One of the Boys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, she might be especially girly like his sweet little princess. The third possible character is the socially awkward one who gets understanding and encouragement from her father, and of course any girl who looks up to her father so much that she wants to follow in his footsteps like in Never a Self-Made Woman. At times, the girl can also end up as a Bratty Teenage Daughter (or Spoiled Brat if the father is rich).\nIn the likely chance that she has a younger brother, she is very protective of him. Daddy is typically very protective of his girl as well, ranging from Twerp Sweating potential suitors to going full Papa Wolf on men who wrong her.\nIf the family consists of a girl, a boy, a mother and a father, the girl will most likely be Daddy's Girl and the boy will be a Momma's Boy, causing conflict in the entire family. If the Daddy's Girl acquires a stepmother, there will most likely be tension between the two, as one (or each) will be jealous of the other and the woman will either become or be seen as a Wicked Stepmother.\nIt's the flip-side of Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas and Momma's Boy.

But what's that? There's a queen? Oh brother, we're in trouble.\nWhile kings and princes can be good or evil and princesses are always good, queens tend to be the royalty version of Always Chaotic Evil. Restrained by a competent king, this usually doesn't show, but once a queen is in charge, things get nasty. Either the king is missing or died in an accident (the queen might have helped things along herself), or he's easily manipulated for some reason. Note that there are good queens in fiction, but they normally don't stay around for very long, or at all. And this trope comes into play whether they are ruling in their own right or as regents for the under-age king. (The latter group tends to fall under My Beloved Smother, as well.)\nSubverted pretty much every time the lovely princess becomes queen mid or end-story, or when the queen was a princess in a prequel to the story, and when the princess rules the kingdom much like a queen would, and is only princess in title. Good queens don't need to be listed. They are simply The High Queen.\nIf the evil queen is in charge of a Hive Mind, she is by definition a Hive Queen. Also overlaps with Matriarchy (particularly the Straw Matriarchy) and sometimes Evil Matriarch.\nThe idea that \"only a fool would want to be ruled by a woman\" played heavily into the lives of real life queens in history \u2014 even if their rule might have been decent or competent, many queens tended to be viewed with suspicion or contempt by their male underlings. This is particularly true if the queen's manners and sexual habits were similar to those of powerful men. Another reason was that very often queens were foreigners to the countries of which they became queens (through marriage) and therefore became victim to xenophobic prejudices, especially if there arose a conflict of interests or even a shooting war between the queen's native and adopted countries.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The High Queen, The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, She Is the King, The Good King and President Evil. The next steps down are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, Princely Young Man, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes.

Regardless of what happened \u2014 and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened \u2014 Dad seems to have raised his children on his own, or with help from a mom-substitute.\nMissing Moms are often considered more unusual than a missing father, and are more likely to have their absence explicitly explained. This might be because a man can technically leave his babymamma at any time after knocking her up (or she can leave him) \u2014 it's even possible for him to never find out he's a father. But a woman carrying a child to term and giving birth, then disappearing, is rarer, especially if it was by her own choice, since it contradicts the Closer to Earth image most cultures have of women. If it was Death by Childbirth that disposed of the mother, this is usually mentioned because it adds an extra touch of tragedy to the character's life.\nHowever, the flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all. Missing Moms in general are likely to get a brief mention as to what happened to them, but are far less likely to turn up again in the story, and less likely to be a driving force behind a hero's adventures.\nMissing Moms are almost always remembered in a positive light, unlike Disappeared Dads (although see First Father Wins). Expect the father to wax poetic about the times they shared, and to tell a female hero \"You look so much like your mother.\" Death by Childbirth can be a cause of this. (By contrast, if the Missing Mom is alive and willingly abandoned her child, she will probably be portrayed as worse than an absentee dad note  expect in some period stories \u2014 before the 20th century, children of divorced or legally separated couples were invariably awarded to the father.) This beatification can also lead the way to a Wicked Stepmother if the father remarries, or a child's Tell Me About My Mother. If the mother is dead, the surviving spouse is almost obligated to have a Happier Home Movie about her, such as a wedding video or one with the hero as a baby.\nCombine with Disappeared Dad, and you get Parental Abandonment.\n\nExamples" }

Controlling those emotions is often a sign of maturity and rationality. This character goes beyond that and enters a disturbing, perhaps even creepy, realm of emotional numbness. Be on the lookout for another character making an \"is she even human\" comment about her.\nMaking the character female accentuates the dissonance, as women are traditionally associated with being closer to emotions, in both positive and negative ways. See Mother Nature, Father Science, Hysterical Woman, Tsundere, The Chick, The Heart, Defecting for Love, Fangirl, Security Cling, Manic Pixie Dream Girl, and many, many more. Characteristics (The Stoic, The Hermit) that might be excused or even praised in a man can become disturbing when applied to a young woman, especially once they are extrapolated to become the emotional numbness shown by this character.\nAs emotions are a major part of social interaction, the emotionless girl is usually depicted as Not Good with People and having No Social Skills. Which often leads to her being isolated or even ostracized. Even when not physically isolated, this girl is very likely to be Alone in a Crowd, aloof from the rest of the group.\nThe rare Emotionless Girl that can handle social interaction is usually depicted as a cool manipulator who, while unable to empathize in a normal manner, has learned through experience that most humans have emotions, and these emotions can be triggered by certain actions. She mimics social conventions by heavyhandedly triggering the desired emotions and behavior in others. People who do not react in the expected manner can really confuse her.\nBeing an emotionless girl is not all negatives though. She can be cool in a crisis, i.e., \"she's all business.\" She may have some sort of secret special power linked to her otherworldly detachment. Whether she is an anchor in the midst of chaos, or just quietly mysterious, she's a deviation from the norm.\nSometimes used by animators as the Straight Man or comic foil, especially in noisy, chaotic situations. She may take on the role of The Snark Knight (particularly if she is the manipulative type of emotionless girl).\nNot necessarily a fan of pure logic and reason like The Spock, or as compassionate under the skin as the Tin Man, or wise and profound as Silent Bob, nor necessarily as strong and badass as The Stoic. She just stands out for lacking emotional reactions.\nIn certain instances, she may be an actual Robot Girl or alien. See also Rei Ayanami Expy and The Quiet One. Often contrasted with a more Hot-Blooded partner to form a Red Oni, Blue Oni pair.\nAn common twist on the Emotionless Girl is the Emotionally Repressed Girl. This girl feels the emotions but doesn't express them openly or vividly. Most likely because of a Dark and Troubled Past. These girls can draw the viewers into the scene by forcing one to pick up on her subtle cues - so that when the seemingly Emotionless Girl finally does smile, there's a tremendous amount of satisfaction. In such cases the return of emotions symbolizes a return to humanity, and a healing of whatever trauma they had been carrying.\nThey may suffer from Bad Dreams and/or find it difficult to express gratitude. Contrast Sugar and Ice Personality, who may initially appear emotionless but in fact has a cute inner side.

Some men may subconsciously see through this, and become Sweet on Polly Oliver. Since, in most cultures, she needs a new name, may occasion a Meaningful Rename. Not to be confused with Bifauxnen.\nMany times when this is done in film and TV, the actress playing the crossdressing character rarely does a convincing job (see Hollywood Homely), requiring Suspension of Disbelief on the part of the audience that the other characters encountering her really believe she is a man/boy. On the other hand, quite a few women really did get away with this surprisingly easily in the past, which The Folklore of Discworld phrases as \"in an age before unisex fashions, trousers meant 'man' and skirts meant 'woman'. Trousers plus high-pitched voice meant 'young man'. People didn't expect anything else, and saw what they expected to see.\" As a type of Weirdness Censor, the human mind will simply ignore small details that could give the ruse away, once it has classified a person as either male or female. And in societies in which male and female gender roles are clearly seperated with no room for overlaps, this effect would be even stronger, as the idea of meeting a crossdresser would be even more inconceivable than it is today.\nYou can listen to the full version of the song here." }

Her plight unites the cast, causing them to put aside their differences and work together to save her.\nThe nature of the distress varies. The classic damsel has been kidnapped or captured and is locked away, awaiting rescue and afraid for her life and virtue. She may also be lost or stranded in a hostile area, trapped, desperately ill, or suffering any number of terrible fates where she needs help to survive.\nThis set-up is plausible if the damsel in distress is a beloved character, but can be very jarring if the audience fails to see what's so valuable about the damsel and why the rest of the cast should drop everything to go to her rescue. Some damsels are so annoying that the audience wouldn't mind seeing them dead; others end up in trouble in a way that just screams Character Derailment. This is particularly dangerous for the resident Action Girl who will seem suddenly weak and helpless if her stint as a damsel isn't properly justified \u2014 if the moment is bad enough, she can be demoted to Faux Action Girl. On the other hand, anyone can have a bad day; perhaps she just had a moment of Badass in Distress after being thrown a Distress Ball.\nDon't expect people to sympathize with the damsel if she doesn't free herself, even if she really is helpless. The trend of the moment is to give the damsel something to do besides stand around uselessly. The Damsel out of Distress will put up a fight, which can either help or make things worse. The Defiant Captive damsel will snarl and rage where her meeker sister would scream. There are even subversions in the line of Play-Along Prisoner: the Decoy Damsel puts on all the appearance of this trope, but her helplessness is all for show.\nSometimes the character gets kidnapped for the sake of her good looks or royal blood, but in other works she's more likely doing something that is a threat to the party that kidnaps her (reporters are common), which allows her to look smart and independent before she needs to be saved. Alternatively, she can end up prisoner as a Heroic Sacrifice; situations where she puts herself in peril so that others can get away are popular, even if her plan ultimately fails.\nGenerally expected to give The Hero a Smooch of Victory when he rescues her. Assuming he does, of course...\nThis is a type of Living MacGuffin. Chained to a Rock is an ancient form; Girl in the Tower and Hypnotize the Princess came later. Damsels in distress are often Bound and Gagged, especially where Author Appeal is concerned.\nIf the kidnapper in question is particularly nasty, expect an I Have You Now, My Pretty situation to occur.

If the girl is actually faking this for her own benefits, depending on her purposes she's either a Deliberately Distressed Damsel or a Decoy Damsel. A typical damsel that rescues herself is a Damsel out of Distress.

Not uncommonly, this lady is the hero's love interest, and he is striving in order to be able to marry her.

Never married, never thought about marrying, never had a boyfriend or a lover - or at least if she did you don't know about it. She's grey-haired, old-fashioned, conservative, prim, proper, prudish, strait-laced, and disapproving of anything new-fangled. She wears basic black with lace at the collar and cuffs and when she goes out she puts on a hat that went out of style in roughly 1920. But she dotes on her nieces and nephews, fusses over the local parson and the friendly neighbourhood policeman, and is sure to offer everyone 'a wee drop' of her special homemade cordial - which, it turns out, could put a 600-pound gorilla into a coma (and sometimes more) after one sip. She drinks it by the gallon with no ill effects.\nAlthough unmarried elderly women have always existed, the Maiden Aunt as a trope first arose in the 1880s. Historically, women had shorter lifespans than men because of the dangers of childbirth: many men married more than once, meaning that any woman who didn't marry at a young age had a good chance of marrying later on. But in the mid-Victorian era women's life expectancies increased due to advances in modern medicine while men's lifespans decreased, partly due to civilian conscription during wartime and, as we know now, partly due to increasing use of tobacco. Suddenly there were myriads, even millions of women who had no chance of marrying and, unlike unmarried men, had little chance of immigrating to a place where they could find a spouse. Decades later, these women reached old age and became known as maiden aunts.\nThey were especially thick on the ground in the US in the 1900-1930 period and in the Commonwealth in the 1950-1980 period - these were the women whose potential husbands died in the US Civil War and in World War I, respectively. In the 1920s they were often known as \"Victorian aunts\", because they had grown up in (and for the most part never quite left) the Victorian era. Often also called \"spinsters\" and \"old maids\", although the latter term is usually discredited as offensive nowadays. If you were born in The Sixties you may remember how incredibly common they were, both in fiction and in Real Life.\nOf course, many real-life women remained unmarried for reasons other than the one stated above. Some were lesbians, some were asexual, some preferred a career to marriage, some gave up the chance of marriage to look after aging parents, and some simply didn't want the bother of a husband and family. In fiction, though, they tend to be prudish, sexless conservatives who have never worked for a living. Some are kindly and sweet, some are bitter and angry, some are in a Cloudcuckooland. Often played straight in mysteries and for laughs in comedies. There aren't many subversions out there - younger audiences are usually squicked by any hint of sexuality in an older woman.

Mary Sue ran the ship, and ran it so well she received the Nobel Peace Prize, the Vulcan Order of Gallantry and the Tralfamadorian Order of Good Guyhood.\" \u2014 Excerpt from A Trekkie's Tale by Paula Smith.\nMary Sue is a derogatory term primarily used in Fan Fic circles to describe a particular type of character. This much everyone can agree on. What that character type is, exactly, differs wildly from circle to circle, and often from person to person.\nTV Tropes doesn't get to set what the term means; the best we can do is capture the way it is used. Since there's no consensus on a precise definition, the best way to describe the phenomenon is by example of the kind of character pretty much everyone could agree to be a Mary Sue. These traits usually reference the character's perceived importance in the story, their physical design and an irrelevantly over-skilled or over-idealized nature.\nThe name \"Mary Sue\" comes from the 1974 Star Trek fanfic A Trekkie's Tale. Originally written as a parody of the standard Self Insert Fic of the time (as opposed to any particular traits), the name was quickly adopted by the Star Trek fanfiction community. Its original meaning mostly held that it was an Always Female Author Avatar, regardless of character role or perceived quality. Often, the characters would get in a relationship with either Kirk or Spock, turn out to have a familial bond with a crew member, be a Half-Human Hybrid masquerading as a human, and die in a graceful, beautiful way to reinforce that the character was Too Good For This Sinful Earth. (Or space, as the case may be.)\nEven back then, there wasn't a total consensus on what was or wasn't Mary Sue, since it's not always immediately obvious which character is an Author Avatar. As this essay reveals, suspiciously Mary Sue-like characters were noted in subscriber-submitted articles for 19th-century childrens' magazines, making this trope Older Than You Think.\nThe prototypical Mary Sue is an original female character in a fanfic who obviously serves as an idealized version of the author mainly for the purpose of Wish Fulfillment. She's exotically beautiful, often having an unusual hair or eye color, and has a similarly cool and exotic name. She's exceptionally talented in an implausibly wide variety of areas, and may possess skills that are rare or nonexistent in the canon setting. She also lacks any realistic, or at least story-relevant, character flaws \u2014 either that or her \"flaws\" are obviously meant to be endearing.\nShe has an unusual and dramatic Back Story. The canon protagonists are all overwhelmed with admiration for her beauty, wit, courage and other virtues, and are quick to adopt her as one of their True Companions, even characters who are usually antisocial and untrusting; if any character doesn't love her, that character gets an extremely unsympathetic portrayal. She has some sort of especially close relationship to the author's favorite canon character \u2014 their love interest, illegitimate child, never-before-mentioned sister, etc. Other than that, the canon characters are quickly reduced to awestruck cheerleaders, watching from the sidelines as Mary Sue outstrips them in their areas of expertise and solves problems that have stymied them for the entire series. (See Common Mary Sue Traits for more detail on any of these cliches.)\nIn other words, the term \"Mary Sue\" is generally slapped on a character who is important in the story, possesses unusual physical traits, and has an irrelevantly over-skilled or over-idealized nature.\nOver time, a male variant started to see use. Marty Stu (also known as Gary Stu, for those who prefer rhyme to alliteration) wasn't really that much different from Mary. Also an Author Avatar, it usually had implications of being a male crew member that tended to completely outshine established canon members in their roles and often become the best starship captain, ever. See The Ace. Since the female characters of Star Trek were all in secondary roles at best, the relationship angle was generally disregarded as being any sort of qualifier. Because of the not-entirely-unjustified perception that Most Fanfic Writers Are Girls, Marty Stu didn't really catch on for a long time.\nOriginally, the term used to apply exclusively to fanfiction, but by the time of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the term \"Canon Sue\" started seeing use, applying Author Avatar standards to canon works (most likely inspired by the backlash against Wesley Crusher; even Wil Wheaton has decried the character's obnoxiousness). It was around this time that the term started to lose a concrete meaning, since the label started getting applied even to characters who weren't explicit self-inserts (such as the title character of the episode \"The Empath\"), but just happened to use similar tropes. It was also (most likely) around this time that the term started to gain its pejorative tone.\nFinally, the advent of the Internet allowed the term to migrate out of the Star Trek community to most fandoms, losing pretty much any real meaning in the process. There are dozens upon dozens of essays that offer interpretations of what the term means, generally basing it off of some usages of it, but none of them are truly comprehensive or accepted. Using the term in most contexts isn't too far off from Flame Bait, generally provoking the defendant into rants. Much Internet Backdraft has resulted, especially if the term is applied to a canon character on a popular show.\nThese last two paragraphs are why it's so hard to really nail down a definition of \"Mary Sue\": the term has started to be used in a much wider context, and to mean much wider things, than it once did, and there's no way to figure out which of those characteristics are necessary and sufficient to define a Mary Sue." }

Unfortunately, she's often right; the Powers That Be are not immune to her wealth, connections and influence, and she or her family can and will corrupt or coerce them into overlooking her bad behavior. Very likely to be a Narcissist and expect (If it's a Mature rated film or TV show) the term Country Matters to pop up in the same sentence.\nHer natural enemy is the Cool Loser heroine. Whenever their eternal, jealousy-fueled struggle over possessions, boyfriends, and status is sparked anew, quarter will neither be asked for nor given.\nUsually the Veronica in a Betty and Veronica situation, if she's even presented as a love interest at all. Unlikely to be a Fille Fatale; she's too outwardly mean for that. Frequently on the Snob end of Slobs Versus Snobs. It's a Costume Party, I Swear, the Prank Date, and the Party Scheduling Gambit are just some of the many nasty tricks she plays. Often receives her comeuppance at the hands of a member of her own Girl Posse in a Backstabbing the Alpha Bitch moment. Normally joined by a Beta Bitch who assists her in her various cruel deeds.\nContrast with Spoiled Sweet, where a girl is made out to be the Alpha Bitch, but is instead quite a sweetheart. Compare and Contrast with Lovable Alpha Bitch who is this trope with a heart of gold. This trope is probably so common because everyone who wasn't homeschooled knew someone like this... or was one.\nIf she's not the cheerleader type with the fake smile, but is the unglamorous girl who will fight to be the best in her class, she's the Academic Alpha Bitch. Though almost always a she, rare male Alpha Bitches (called Alpha Brats) do exist, but they're just that - rare. They're distinct from the Jerk Jock in that they're mainly catty and manipulative, rather than physically threatening.\nNot to be confused with the Prison Alpha Bitch, found exclusively in women's jail, whose methods of bullying are much more brutal and whose goal isn't social status but outright dominance." }

She is very likely to be sexually dominant (ethically or unethically), but doesn't have to be. Instead of being overtly sexual, she might be a dominatrix in a nonsexual way of Playing to the Fetishes. For example, she might be an animal tamer who use her skill on humans for plot purposes.\nThe typical Dominatrix will wear a very strict (yet usually quite revealing) uniform and carry a whip or similar tool. Her clothes are usually made from leather or rubber, and often include Thigh-High Boots. Don't be surprised if she takes a dominant attitude to almost everyone at almost all times...actually, be grateful if it stays at \"almost\". However, expect some people to make sure to misbehave around her.\nSimply being sexually dominant does not make a female character into a dominatrix. It must be her defining trait, and overtly so.\nAlso, the character doesn't have to be an actual character: One variation of Good Angel, Bad Angel is to replace the angel with a woman dressed to look sweet and romantic and the devil with a woman dressed like a dominatrix.\nIn a way, every Dominatrix is a fictional character...and this includes dominatrices in Real Life. Even when a sexually dominant woman has the dominance as her primary sexual identity, it's still just one of her many traits - not the one thing that defines her. The dominatrix, on the other hand, is a professional whose role is to fulfill a masochistic fantasy. This might be considered a kind of sex work, but most dominatrices do not include sex or any form of nudity or physical contact in the services they provide. In fiction, however, a Dominatrix character does not have to have a job at all. Or anything else that might distract her from the plot (or lack thereof). If she does have a job that is not related to sex or taming, she's probably living in a Fetish-Fuel Future compatible with being dominatrix at work anyway.\nCompare to Bastard Girlfriend, whose sex appeal is based on her physical and verbal abuse and All Women are Doms, All Men are Subs in which this is the only role women are allowed to have in BDSM.\nNo Examples, Please" }

In Darker and Edgier versions, this will often mean a love of (other people's) pain and suffering. Softer portrayals reduce this to a fervent militarism and devotion to the ideals of whichever totalitarian bunch she works for. Naturally, she'll usually be seen sporting a German or Russian accent, along with either a natty military uniform or something black and form-fitting. Whether or not she's vulnerable to good-guy seduction and subversion is highly variable. However, she's invariably attracted to power (which the hero lacks and the Big Bad has).\nBaronesses tend to come in one of two flavours: Sexpot or Rosa Klebb.\nThe Sexpot is, as you'd expect, young-ish and sexy. Her sadism or (in milder versions) fervent militarism is presented as at least a bit enticing to our (male) hero, who she's likely to be attracted to despite herself. Her ice-queen facade is pretty likely to crack a little before the story is over. Her chances of surviving the story are variable to good, depending on how much she lets herself fall for our hero. Most sexpot Baronesses like to Whip It Good.\nThe Rosa Klebb (named for the James Bond villain) is middle-aged and very much not attractive, but is more likely to be the Big Bad herself rather than just working for him. She is immune to the hero's charms, and ominous emphasis is placed upon her utter asexuality, or upon hints that she likes the ladies. Bond-type heroes will be horrified by her, like she had three heads. No matter what, she will be dead as a doornail before the credits roll. No exceptions.\n(If, as with the Bond film and novel From Russia with Love, you find the two types of Baronesses in the same plot, expect to find the Klebb character with an unrequited crush on the Sexpot.)\nIs this trope laced with sexism and homophobia? Of course. It hails from mid-20th-century spy and adventure stories like Ian Fleming's Bond novels, which are full of that sort of malarkey. However, in these surroundings, the Baroness will almost undoubtedly also be the coolest female character in the whole story.\nThe stereotype of the implausibly attractive Communist or Nazi female officer, and her counterpart, the threatening, mannish sadist, is common in campier WWII and Cold War stories. The Russian example has some basis in fact, as the Soviet military did include more female officers than the US military (permitting women to fly in combat in WWII \u2014 a couple of whom became aces), but really, that just meant that they had a few more than none.\nThe Sexpot type of Baroness can sometimes overlap with The Vamp, but most examples of the Baroness, sexy or no, have too much self-respect to use sex as a weapon. She's more about hurting men than pleasing them. See also Those Wacky Nazis or Dirty Communists, for the kind of co-conspirators she usually works with, or Dragon Lady, for the Eastern variety.

Even the \"potions\" could be harmless, if someone just interpreted preparing folk remedies the wrong way (this sadly contributed to the large number of women burnt as witches over the centuries). 21 could also work, depending on how you define \"cursing\".\nGood witches tend to be young and pretty, or at least have aged gracefully. If your subject is nice to look at, but evil, you may well have a Vain Sorceress instead.\nPerhaps because most bards were male back then, wizards get better press, seeming to get more \"good\" and sage-like with age. But then again, there was a time when \"witch\" literally meant \"person who received magical power from the devil\", which would make a non-evil witch an oxymoronnote This connotation would explain why good female mages in modern-based stories are called witches, while those in medieval/historical fiction are not. If a non-evil female magic user appeared in folklore, she'd be referred to with a term like \"sorceress\" or \"fairy godmother\" instead.\nShe's an \"earthy\" version of the Evil Sorcerer (but obviously not Closer to Earth), and might also come in Hollywood Voodoo flavor. It's likely that every witch in existence will be this trope in a setting where Magic is Evil. There might also be some overlap with the Wicked Stepmother and the Evil Matriarch; however, royalty tends to be beautiful.\nIn settings tending more towards Magic Realism than typical fantasy worlds, their magical powers will be downplayed, but their prophecies will have a bad habit of coming horribly true, especially if they get insulted or snubbed.\nUsually uses Black Magic.

Because these associations are culture-dependent and tend to change, what exactly constitutes a \"Tomboy\" is subjective. Historically, any girl interested in science, mechanics, or combat has been called tomboyish; today, calling these pursuits \"unfeminine\" is considered by many to be old-fashioned at best.\nHowever, even where gender roles are relatively lax or fluid, choices made regarding media consumption, recreation, and fashion, remain segregated for the most part. Thus the Tomboy remains a current figure and a popular one for various reasons: A woman might chafe at how \"femininity\" limits her choices and find a like minded heroine empowering; boys might find a girl who likes the things they do more relatable. Tomboys are often seen as a great way to appeal to both male and female demographics with the same characters. For still others, a love of Tomboys may have nothing to do with their opinion on gender. The audience finds (minor) transgressions of accepted roles \"cute\" or funny. A great deal of media takes this latter position, sometimes presenting the Tomboy as sympathetic but, in the end, immature or even troubled.\nIn story, justifications also vary. Some girls might just enjoy doing boyish things more. Perhaps she's daddy's little girl and so wants to do things with him. A similar possibility is that she was Raised by Dudes. Maybe she has no brothers and so the father raises his daughter the way he would a son. It could be that she has no sisters but several brothers, and to be included with them she engages in boyish activities. Or maybe she is socially awkward and simply wants to go somewhere where she thinks the awkwardness will be accepted because she is a \"foreign visitor\" anyway.\nWhile Tomboys are subject to Flanderization, according to which they all hate \"girly things\" (like the color pink, dressing up, playing house, shopping), most in real life simply happen to fall outside of gender norms in a few respects; aside from these \"quirks\", a Tomboy might also have \"feminine\" interests. Even if she doesn't, she need not have any antipathy toward those who do. Indeed her best friend may be a Girly Girl.\nThe outcome of the Tomboy's character arc tends to indicate the intended Aesop. If the Tomboy doesn't \"grow out of it,\" or find her inner femininity, this suggests that gender and sexuality boundaries are more permeable, and that transgressing these boundaries is acceptable. If, on the other hand, a Tomboy needs to be normalized in some way, this implies that her Tomboyish appearance or traits are somehow problematic. Consequently, Tomboyish traits can serve as an exploration of gender and sexuality.\n Sub-tropes/Characteristics often attributed to Tomboys include:" }

Some go out and battle Dramatic Evil, usually with a lot of mystic firepower and weird outfits (usually a glammed-up Mini Dress Of Power) and called attacks. This is not magic for magic's sake; the character rarely finds this enjoyable but often gets morally cowed into it.\nThe action-oriented Magical Girl Warriors have the extra bonus of being marketed to male demographics, so they can be very lucrative; in this case they often resemble Distaff Counterparts of Japanese superheroes, particularly Sentai and other Henshin Hero characters. This contributed significantly to the odds of the associated franchises being exported to the West. Due to sharing many of the typical teenage superhero tropes, these characters ended up to be much more representative of the Magical Girl genre outside Japan, as opposed to, for example, Cute Witches.\nThey are very prone to Kicking Ass in All Her Finery.\nCharacters frequently appearing in this type of franchise include the Dark Magical Girl and the occasional Spear Counterpart to the Improbably Female Cast, who is frequently referred to as \"Magic Knight\". note Not to be confused with the unrelated Magic Knight trope, or with Magic Knight Rayearth" }

He is either unable to get a date at all, or has had his sensitive poet's heart broken by a cruel bitch who was only toying with his affections, forcing him to withdraw from all feminine companionship. Exactly how strongly this is exaggerated depends on the writers.\nHowever, because he is a genuinely good and kind person, fate smiles upon him \u2014 the perfect girl for him enters his life. She is beautiful, kind, domestic, and utterly and eternally devoted to him. However, she's often not exactly human by most definitions \u2014 she is a Goddess, a Demon, or a Vampire, or a Witch, or an Extraterrestrial, or an Angel, or a Robot, or a Ghost, or a virtual being born of an advanced computer program, or under a spell/curse, or an immortal sorceress, or some combination of any or all of the above. Sometimes the term is just metaphorical, although this is usually used in a critical way implying she's too good to be true.\nOf course the path of true love never runs smoothly (especially since she loves you and everybody) but the pairing of dork and demigoddess runs into especially large bumps \u2014 usually comedic ones. Despite this and his initial misgivings, though, true love blossoms for the once-hapless hero. May or may not include Closet Sublet.\nEntries in this genre often come packed with generous quantities of Fanservice, but this is by no means mandatory. Sometimes it overlaps with The Unwanted Harem, but requires more Willing Suspension of Disbelief, since her popularity is obvious.\nIn dramatic examples, Magical Girlfriends are ironic blessings. No matter how much she insists, she will tend to give the guy an inferiority complex about himself and being unworthy. Conversely, Magical Girlfriends often feel they cause more problems than they solve, and the guy is just putting up with them due to niceness. Of course, her family almost always gets involved; and rest assured they will get in the way as much as possible.\nIf the relationship actually works, it may become an Interspecies Romance (assuming she does not become fully human, which sometimes happens).\nMagical Girlfriend series show up in shonen, but seem to skyrocket in popularity within the seinen crowd. There are a couple of shojo series too, one being Yuu Watase's Gender Flipped Magical Boyfriend series Absolute Boyfriend, another being Naoko Takeuchi's Orphaned Series Toki Meca, which replaces the couple with a Romantic Two-Girl Friendship.\nJust as the Magical Girls genre was inspired by Bewitched, it seems likely that both that show and I Dream of Jeannie are somewhere in the DNA of the Magical Girlfriend.\nCompare and contrast with Manic Pixie Dream Girl. See Well, Excuse Me, Princess! for when the Magical Girlfriend wakes up to how much of a geeky loser her love interest is and begins calling him on it, and Action Girlfriend if she's more action-oriented than magical.

She's still spoiled, slightly naive, perhaps shallow, maybe even selfish (and yes, prone to attitude), but when it comes right down to it she's a loyal friend and doesn't use her money or popularity as an excuse to treat everyone like garbage - though she is often Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense and makes errors out of ignorance. She, of course, is never, ever rude to the hired help, though she may seem slightly condescending at times. She can fit in with the Dumb Blonde stereotype, or she can be smart in a Bunny-Ears Lawyer type of situation. She's typically an equal opportunity friend, hanging out with the popular crowd and the misfits alike. She'll sometimes be paired up with Alpha Bitch or a group thereof as the one nice girl in their midst, or perhaps form a dyad with the female protagonist in a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair. As shallow as she may be, she'll often be the one to Give Geeks a Chance, hooking up with a guy who would never ever be expected to land such a beautiful girl. If she is more intelligent than ditzy, she will have some awareness of the advantages her money and beauty have given her and may be inspired to use these advantages to help those less privileged.\nWhen faced with the need to do some kind of hands on work, (a common way to develop this character) something most of us do naturally, they might actually get excited about the opportunity, having lived in a Gilded Cage (although typically a gilded cage that they enjoy to some extent) and suffered Rich Boredom. \"I always wanted to try this!\" If she succeeds she will be very proud of herself - not in a haughty way but in that \"Hey, I did a thing!\" way. Sometimes she just thinks she succeeded and the more competent people are struggling to fix whatever she messed up. But she's just so happy and sincere about wanting to help, nobody can break her heart and tell her that she just needs to stay out of the way. This is quite happily Truth in Television.\nA mild warning - the Spoiled Sweet card must be played carefully. If the writer isn't careful, she'll just wind up as a Canon Sue or a whiny, ditzy little brat and may even turn back into the Alpha Bitch.\nDiffers from Jerk with a Heart of Gold in that she's always outwardly nice to begin with; if she's a Jerk with a Heart of Gold she doesn't belong here. Note that a Spoiled Sweet character doesn't have to be always nice to qualify, this kind of character is certainly prone to a selfish moment or two, or even a What the Hell, Hero? moment if her selfishness gets the better of her.\nA Sub-Trope of Idle Rich.\nCompare with Lovable Alpha Bitch, Ojou, Princess Classic, and Uncle Pennybags.

Yes, that's confusing, but that's American Federalism for you.. She listened to jazz, danced dances like the Foxtrot, the Tango, the Shimmy, the Black Bottom, the Baltimore Buzz, and the Charleston, wore make-up for the first time since the 18th century, drank with the boys (in America, she was about as big an opponent of the 18th Amendmentnote Which prohibited alcohol. as she was a fan of the 19th), spoke in slang and cusses, and enjoyed various other delights The Roaring Twenties had to offer. Short hair, short skirts, short, loose & low-waisted evening gowns, turned-up silk stockings, boyish figures, and swanky cloche hats were a must.\nTheir sexual liberty was a result of the feminist movements like women entering the workforce and women's rights to vote, and of women's growing hatred of the classic Double Standard; that promiscuous men were \"studs,\" while promiscuous women were \"whores.\" In their eyes, \"sheiks\" and \"shebas\" were equal, so they could be just as sexually free. Another factor was the then popular view of women as house wives and mothers who should be subordinate to their men and preferably not leave the house.\nThe popular image of the flapper we know of dates back to the late 1920s. In fact, the concept dates way back at least in the 1910s. While the word flapper stuck in every dictionary as early as The Gay Nineties, the flapper girl started to evolve during World War One and the Prohibition era. Contrary to popular imagery, flappers did not always wore sleek bobs, fringed dresses and feathered headbands. Earlier flappers had that loose silhouette, yet wore wide-brimmed hats and longer, narrower skirts. But as the decade progressed, and with the help of prominent women like Coco Chanel, hats became tighter and narrower, and skirts became shorter, and the silhouette more streamlined, like the image you see above.\nThe concept also spread east to Japan and China, where it spawned the \"modern girl\" (モダンガール modan gaaru, or モガ moga for short) and \"modern Miss\" (摩登小姐 modeng xiaojie) cultures respectively.\nThe flapper lifestyle and look disappeared after the Wall Street Crash and the following Great Depression. The high-spirited attitude and hedonism were less acceptable during the economic hardships of the 1930s.\nCompare and contrast The Lad-ette." }

When a show does it to the male audience, it's Sex Sells.\nGirls have been accused of this since forever. Sometimes it's true, more often it's wishful thinking, but it does occur in fiction a lot. Occasionally it's given a more dramatic justification when it's revealed that this insincere sexual aggression is really a way of feeling powerful and in control, covering up deep seated emotional insecurities, thus explaining why they can never act on them.

If she's a military or political leader of some sort, then you can bet that she got the position with help from her father or another male relative. The author or the characters have to choose who gets to join in on the hijinks or know the secrets; chances are, most of the people they choose are going to be men. Women who join in are most commonly there as a \"bonus\" to someone else, often as a love interest or a family member.\nThere are shades to this. We may have the Action Girl who has achieved a lot and gone up in society, but whenever her background is brought up, it is always a man in her family (father, uncle, older brother or husband) who is prominent as her predecessor or a key to her success. It will be strongly implied that she would never have gotten into this Business if she hadn't been motivated and trained by her powerful male relatives who are active on the same field. In short, a personal, emotional relationship with a mentor is needed, not just a professional one driven by her own independent ambitions. She might have grown into her own badassery, but the story will continue to define her as the more important male character's apprentice or heiress.\nAnother variation is when a female character who is already powerful or who has an important role without male aid meets her lover. Since prominent women usually require a partner who is at least as interesting and powerful as they, the story will often start revolving around him once they meet. Suddenly, the conflict doesn't seem as important to her anymore. If things quiet down and they get married, he usually has a great career ahead of him, but she's content to slow hers down to be a wife or mother. From the moment they become an item, no one mentions her previous accomplishments anymore; they just talk about her only as half of a couple. Her partner's heroism is still remembered and talked about, but she is lucky if she even gets mentioned a few years down the line.\nA perceived \"barrier between the sexes\" may be to blame for this \u2014 specifically, the notion that women and men can't socialize without justifying it with a sexual or familial bond. Writers use this trope to justify to viewers (presumed male) why they should care about the female character at all.\nIn short, this is another example of Double Standard. Of course, this tends to lead to a double bind situation in which people will discredit a woman's accomplishments because she is connected to a man.\nPlease note that this trope is more subtle than Dungeonmaster's Girlfriend and other similar tropes. Chances are that most of the examples here do get some credit for being Action Girls; that doesn't negate that their fathers, boyfriends, etc. are more important than they are. Also remember that male characters owing their success to more powerful women are generally not inversions of this trope, as they rarely carry the same implications.\nGoing hand with this is Men Act, Women Are, which is about what comes from the man, and where the woman comes from. Compare Lineage Comes from the Father, which deals with bloodlines. I Have Brothers is a more mild version of this trope that nonetheless associates a woman's less traditionally feminine interests with a male influence rather than her own volition.\nNot to be confused with Self-Made Man where a person gains importance on his/her own.

For the others, she typically commands such high respect and devotion that her subjects will march to and fight at the Gates of Hell without question if she needed them to.\nLike other Über-character types, The High Queen runs a risk of becoming a Mary Sue, though mostly an acceptable one at that.\nThe presence of a High Queen is sometimes an indication of a Matriarchy.\nThe Iron Lady is the non-royal version of this trope; because non-royals have to fight for their position, such characters generally combine elements of The High Queen and God Save Us from the Queen!. If she literally fights, she is a Lady of War. If her fighting is more indirect and subtle, she is Silk Hiding Steel.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are God Save Us from the Queen!, The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, She Is the King, Iron Lady, The Good King and President Evil. The next steps down are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next step up is The Emperor." }

She's established from the very beginning as a powerful, capable heroine, but never gets to actually do anything heroic. She has a well-grounded reputation as a strong fighter in her field, but always fails miserably in the line of battle. Her talents and skills are well-known to fellow characters, but for some strange reason they're never seen by the viewers outside of perhaps a Day in the Limelight episode.\nHer status only exists as an established reputation and depends heavily on Genre Blindness; she never acts like the modern heroine she's supposed to be. Sometimes, the only way she qualifies as anything more than the Damsel in Distress is if you Take Our Word for It. If the writers are feeling merciful, however, the Faux Action Girl can be relied on to actually defeat her share of Mooks - or, in rarer cases, a female enemy.\nThe key to identifying a Faux Action Girl is the disproportionate hype - whether she's overrated or under-performing. Also note that context does play a role; for example, in a show full of incompetents who think they're tough fighters, it doesn't matter if a female character behaves the same way. It is also possible to have a female character who doesn't fight or isn't as capable as some others for perfectly justified reasons. A Faux Action Girl is much less powerful or competent than comparable male characters and true Action Girls for no logical reason. Strangely, villainesses are rarely Faux Action Girls.\nThe Worf Effect used too many times on a legitimate Action Girl may turn her into a Faux Action Girl.\nPlease note that a Faux Action Girl is someone who already has a reputation as a fighter. If she is just a captured girl then she's a Damsel in Distress. If she gets rid of the Distress Ball, she's just a Badass in Distress. If she has just started fighting and doesn't have the experience/fame handy still, she's likely Skilled, but Naive or a Naïve Newcomer, and there's still room to see if she can grow into a real Action Girl or not. Merely because an Action Girl is captured does not automatically entail her transformation into a Faux Action Girl; generally it is down to the nature of her kidnap/capture and how she deals with this circumstance in contrast to her other informed feats.\nThe characterization usually involves a form of Informed Ability: Most of these girls have big reputations and great past exploits. More or less the Distaff Counterpart to Miles Gloriosus and Fake Ultimate Hero.\nIf much of the show's screentime is dedicated to showing the girl in question training and practicing only to lose when it counts, that's not this trope. That's Hard Work Hardly Works, and it can hit anyone who is not The Hero.\nAlso contrast with Chickification, in which the producers take a character who is shown to be a legitimate Action Girl and make her incompetent. See also Standard Female Grab Area, the standard weakness of a Faux Action Girl, even though showing her drugged while her back is turned would make more sense.\nLike the Standard Female Grab Area and White Magician Girl, this trope is often caused by writers who want females in their action show, but are unwilling (or not allowed) to show a woman being hit by a man. In many cases, the Faux Action Girl will suddenly develop into an actual Action Girl when faced with a female opponent (because a Cat Fight is just fine), only to return to Faux status as soon as that fight is over." }

Perhaps it's because kicks have better range, or feet with shoes are less sensitive to pain than bare hands, or they have stronger legs than arms. However, in her case it's partly due to the Rule of Sexy.\nIn reality, women note  and most men that don't explicitly aim to become a Top-Heavy Guy - after all, legs carry more weight and get more use by default do generally have much stronger lower bodies than upper bodies, which means that they're naturally more inclined to use kicks than punches. Also, as the first instinct of any attacker is to bind or otherwise incapacitate the arms (and leave the legs relatively free so that you don't have to carry her), it's quite practical to deal damage with your means of locomotion.

A type of hairstyle where the hair is gathered into two \"tails\" on either side of the head. Usually, but not always, left loose, braided tails have a more Granola Girl or tomboy connotation. The hair must be gathered above the base of the neck; hair gathered below the jawline generally says something entirely different about the character.\nUsed as a visual clue that the character is young or immature. This view may have come from the Chinese custom of unmarried women wearing their hair in two buns on either side of the head (which if combined with the twin tails yields a well-known icon). Or from the modern European custom that a grown woman wore her hair up.\nIf an older woman is trying to disguise herself as a child, expect her to sport pigtails. Also can be found on an older woman if the writers want the audience to grasp that she's child-like in temperament: playful, fun, and possibly innocent. (If the character is evil, this may indicate that she is a Psychopathic Womanchild to some degree.)\nCould also show up on a Little Miss Badass.\nPigtails are commonly found on Tsunderes, either full pigtails or a variation (\"Tsundere Tails\"), which leaves the majority of the hair down with tails on each side of the head. This may be to indicate her childish temperament: prone to physically expressing displeasure and temper tantrums; or to symbolize her dual nature (tsun-tsun/dere-dere). Twintails are one of the three parts of the ultimate Grade S Zettai Ryouiki (the other two being Grade A Zettai Ryouiki and Tsundere attitude).\nCan be combined with Regal Ringlets, in which case they're indicative of both high social status and youth, perhaps suggesting the wearer is a spoiled child. When the tails are impossibly huge and curled, then it's Mega Twintails, which indicates a compromise between femininity and tomboyishness. Another popular variation is replacement or pairing with loads and loads of hair decs.\nThis is a very common trope in porn to make older actresses appear younger, especially when paired with a Sexy Schoolwoman outfit.\nA Super Trope to Mega Twintails.

You know the type. Morally ambiguous, dressed all in black with legs up to here, she slinks into the PI's office, sometimes holding a cigarette on a long, long holder, saying \"Oh, Mr. Rockhammer, you're the only one who can help me find out who killed my extremely wealthy husband.\" Did she do it? Do I care? Wait, where'd that saxophone music come from? Whatever her story is, whether she did it or not, she's definitely keeping some secrets.\nThe Femme Fatale is sexy and she knows it. Made famous by Film Noir and hard-boiled detective stories, the Femme Fatale manipulates and confuses The Hero with her undeniable aura of sexiness and danger. He knows that she's walking trouble and knows much more about the bad guys than he might or she should, but damn it if he can't resist her feminine wiles.\nUnlike the virginal and sweet Damsel in Distress (or Action Girl), the Femme Fatale exploits with everything she's got to wrap men around her finger. (In some eras, use of make-up is a tell-tale sign.) However, Status Quo Is God, so by the end of the story, the Femme Fatale must either be reformed by the hero to the side of good and lose much of her appeal in the process, or be outwitted by him to her doom.\nIf the Femme Fatale is vying for the hero's romantic attentions, she will almost never win because of her illegal and low means of beating out her sweeter and purer rival, and the hero will decide that she's not worth the trouble she causes. This remains true even if she becomes a reformed character.\nWhat separates the Femme Fatale from The Vamp is that the Femme Fatale uses femininity and sensuality instead of upfront sexual advances. Her wiles include apparent helplessness and distress, and appeals to the man's greed, desire for revenge, or gullibility, as well as the implication of possible romance or just sexual rewards, compared to The Vamp's reliance on raunchy sex or the promise of it and utter amorality otherwise. Possibly as a result of this, she is more likely to be portrayed sympathetically than the average vamp.\nThe Femme Fatale is generally villainous, and heroic exceptions, most notably, the leading ladies of Mission: Impossible or Charlie's Angels who using their feminine wiles in an artificial context to snare the bad guy, are more Naughty Is Good.\nOften the Lady in Red, and even more often the Woman in Black, but possibly dressed like everyone else so as to not be Colour-Coded for Your Convenience. The Femme Fatale is one of the female character types that can often be seen wearing Opera Gloves, especially in conjunction with her sexy evening gowns, and, during the daytime (particularly in old Film Noir movies), is often seen wearing a \"fascinator\" or \"pillbox\" hat with a partial- or full-face veil. Definitely not above using the Kiss of Distraction.\nIf she can fight, too, then she's really going to be trouble.\nThe younger version of this is the Fille Fatale.\nThis item is available from the Trope Co. catalog." }

A popular combination with The Baroness, but usually not The Vamp or the Femme Fatale, since she prefers to pummel The Hero to a bloody pulp instead of seducing him, but there are certainly exceptions, and these exceptions can be incredibly dangerous.\nShe's usually someone's Evil Counterpart. She tends to enjoy beating up tougher-looking characters, and a man's refusal to fight back tends to annoy her, and the chivalrous guy can end up badly battered.\nYou'd think that this would be the point where the Action Girl and the Dark Magical Girl intersect. Go on, keep thinking that way. We'll see how long you live. Hang on, let me get my stopwatch.\nThe Dark Action Girl is the Dark Magical Girl's polar opposite: fiercely independent, cruelly carefree, and almost never interested in making friends. While the Dark Magical Girl tends to desperately want to be loved, the vast majority of Dark Action Girls would rather be feared. Just as the Dark Magical Girl almost always does a Heel-Face Turn, the Dark Action Girl almost never does. If she is brought over to the side of good, even if only for an episode, expect her to be reluctant about it at best. If she stays, she'll remain more violent and indifferent than the rest of the True Companions. Typically, the Dark Action Girl will only aid the Action Girl against another villain because she considers herself the only one allowed to defeat her.\nIf an All-Loving Hero offers her friendship, expect her to take it as an insult. The Dark Action Girl is generally immune, or at least resistant, to The Power of Friendship. The Power of Love can soften her up sometimes, but it's a crapshoot; the foolish boy could just as easily wind up getting used and discarded, rejected violently, or just plain killed for his trouble. Deliver Us from Evil sometimes happens, but even then, the resulting Action Mom is almost always more of a Sociopathic Hero with the child serving as a Morality Pet. Though, more often than not, especially if her little one is the fruit of an Unholy Matrimony, you just get an Evil Matriarch. Of course, if the child starts picking up some of her mom's habits, she might become a Little Miss Badass, and from there it's a short trip to the scary side of Badass Family.\nFor some reason, while the audience may feel more comfortable for Action Girls to fail to live up to their reputation or follow a standard to avoid being hit, you will almost never find a Faux Dark Action Girl. This is probably because the standards the decade or culture sets for women usually don't apply to villains. But, this doesn't mean that Faux Dark Action Girls do not exist.\nIf there are no Action Girls on the good side and all of the heroic females are damsels in distress, the work is likely using the Madonna-Whore Complex trope.\nCompare Classy Cat-Burglar, Dark Magical Girl, and Dark Chick.\nAction Girl + Dark Action Girl = Designated Girl Fight.\n\nExamples" }

If you think a normal Mama Bear is scary, hell hath no fury like a Motherly Scientist with access to One-Man Army levels of weaponry/technology/money/superpowers to protect her children.

Disneyfication aside, male bears are notoriously poor parents in the animal kingdom (infanticide among bears is the main reason why mama bears are so protective in the first place), whereas male (and female) wolves will react to their offspring being threatened in a very similar manner to mother bears.\nSometimes overlaps with Apron Matron and Pregnant Badass.

See also the non-human counterpart, Monster Is a Mommy. Not to be confused with Bears Are Bad News (unless you're dealing with a literal Mama Bear). The Violently Protective Girlfriend is a much younger form of this trope that applies when the mate is in danger. Evil characters can use this too; after all, Even Evil Has Loved Ones. A particular Subtrope is the Badass and Child Duo which can take the form of a female badass protecting an orphaned, unrelated young child, though male badasses are more common.\nRemember when adding examples that this is a female only trope. The male equivalent is \"Papa Wolves\" so all Spear Counterparts should be placed there. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, it's a Battle Couple.

In complete contrast to her other variation, is not only a pleasure to be around, but is also so the go to girl for advice and help. These characters usually make good leaders, because though generally fun, insightful, they are still firm in decisions, trustworthy, and speak their minds. Also like the Spicy Latina, the character will usually be sexually liberated and have no qualms acting in a sexual manner, though usually in a less pronounced manner. The positive version is now portrayed a lot more than the negative version, mainly because of the Unfortunate Implications, that portraying black women in only this way had. It's also rather common for the positive variant to be the Only Sane Woman of a group, in which case her \"sass\" will be more like \"exasperated sarcasm\".\nThe odds that she's a Fag Hag are directly proportionate to her weight. Arguably the Distaff Counterpart to the Scary Black Man, though she can be quite scary herself when pissed off. Might also be a white character's Black Best Friend. Close cousin to the Spicy Latina.\nThere is a variation on this, more subdued but no less expressive: the regal Deadpan Snarker, who will often be well-spoken and articulate, with a more highbrow vocabulary and a regal, imperious manner of expressing herself, but still willing to toss subtle (or unsubtle) barbs and make herself heard.

The Vain Sorceress is obsessed with using magic to maintain her beauty. If the Hot Witch uses magic to stay beautiful, it is not an obsession that clouds her ability to have other concerns. The Black Magician Girl's primary characteristic is the use of magic for offense, and is usually an Action Girl. The Hot Witch's powers and personality are of a more subtle and mysterious nature. If they're using their magic to only appear beautiful to others, see Master of Illusion. If they actually change their own, usually ugly form to something beautiful to tempt someone, see Shapeshifting Seducer.\nIt should be noted that this trope is much Older Than They Think, given that the original descriptions of a witch was a young, attractive, and wise woman, before it was changed to the ugly, evil hag much more commonly known today.\nContrast Wicked Witch. Also, don't confuse this trope for another type of Hot Witch." }

The stereotypical fangirl is, well, a girl who loves a fictional canon exclusively for one or more of the male characters, usually distilled down to a couple personality elements and/or appearance to the exception of other things such as backstory, abilities, and Character Development within the canon itself.  Often, this obsession is a sexual fetish.  Fangirls have existed for longer than you may think: the David Duchovny Estrogen Brigade was a terrifying force on The X Files' group on USENET (a sort of Bronze Age webforum).\nHappens in real-life to terrifying extents. Also shows up in anime. A group of fangirls with a common interest in a person may spontaneously form an Instant Fan Club. They can be scary.\nWhen her interests gravitates around the Boys Love and Yaoi Guys, we are in front of a Yaoi Fangirl, the scariest type for a certain side of the public... that being the side that's met them. Expect declarations within the target fandom of Its Popular Now It Sucks when girls start liking it and \"polluting\" the forums with their \"simplistic\" view of the canon, spawning Flame Wars between these two groups because it's Serious Business on who is considered a true fan of the subject in question. Fangirls will be accused of Completely Missing The Point due to their frequent disregard for anything outside of a couple characters and their relationships.\nReal-world fangirls of all types are leading causes of Draco In Leather Pants, Misaimed Fandom, Ship To Ship Combat, Crack Pairing and Crack Fic, and the addition (or removal) of trying to clarify things. If they're a Periphery Demographic, they may insist they are actually the primary (or, failing that, that they're the ones that \"get it\"). Besides the leather pantsing, they are often fond of Fanon featuring Motive Decay, Flanderization, Badass Decay, Woobiefication, Die For Our Ship, and... well, the list goes on.\nDo not attempt to clarify a Fangirl's muddying of the line between Canon and Fanon. As noted above, they often travel in packs, and can get vicious.\nIt is not always a pejorative term (though this being the internet, it often is); some people use the term \"fangirl\" to mean nothing more than a female Otaku\u2014that is, a fanboy's legitimate female counterpart.  A woman or girl describing herself as a fangirl is not necessarily a cause for alarm.  The only real difference between a fanboy and a fangirl is that fangirls are often more vocal about what they like." }

Most commonly found in science fiction and Sentai shows, but not exclusively. Despite their artificial nature, Robot Girls are never \u2014 well, hardly ever \u2014 sexless; they are at the very least cute as hell, and more often drop-dead gorgeous, if not outright seductresses. (Robotic males, on the other hand...) Despite how cute or sexy she may be, though, the Robot Girl is often a dangerous opponent in a fight, even if they're only created to do common household chores.\nThe robot girl is not necessarily a completely mechanical creation \u2014 the character type can encompass cyborgs, bioroids and even virtual/nonphysical beings.\nWhile not unheard of in American shows (My Living Doll, Small Wonder, Mann And Machine) the robot girl on American TV tends to be a gimmick or MacGuffin on which to hang a series concept rather than a character type in its own right.\nOf course, Japan being the worldwide leader in consumer electronics, androids are quite popular in that country. These androids could be male, but due to the fandom's preferences, most of them are sleek, sexy females. (Technically they would be gynoids, if you're the kind of person who cares.)\nSometimes the character is shown to be an android by some unusual accessory to cue the audience. Due to the popularity of To Heart's Multi, having antennae-like ears is almost universally understood (although, like the character in this picture, visible mechanical joints are another dead giveaway).\nVery often an Innocent Fanservice Girl. After all, why in the world would a drop-dead gorgeous female facsimile have any conception of chastity, much less modesty, programming notwithstanding? If the Robot Girl is the lead female or at least an important one, this innocence and naivety can be a large part of their character or even the theme of the work.\nOccasionally, even if the robot girl is initially depicted as totally emotionless and incapable of compassion, empathy, humor or love, often such traits - or the simulation of such traits - will begin to sneak in. Examples of this have included Cameron from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Eve Edison from Mann & Machine and Rhoda from My Living Doll. Unless, of course, the robots are programmed from the start to simulate - or even genuinely experience - emotion, such as the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica (Reimagined) or the Replicants from Blade Runner.\nCompare Fembot, Projected Man, Robosexual.

After the Yamato Nadeshiko, she's the second-best girl that a boy can bring home to meet his parents and probably the more realistic of the two.

Usually (but not always), they are the mothers of sons, and for whatever reasons can have a bit of trouble cutting the apron strings; as a result, no matter how old the boy (or, for added humor value, man) is, he'll be mothered relentlessly, his mother absolutely smothering him with parental affection... and authority. Using either carrot or stick (sometimes both), his mother will go to any lengths to make sure that, whether he wants to or not, he's not going to be leaving his mother's embrace any time soon. Any attempts on his part will usually result in a passive-aggressive guilt trip for trying to break away and do his own thing. Her poor son, as a result of such domination and badgering, usually ends up a Momma's Boy. For some reason, a lot of these mothers are Jewish. (Although they are also oftentimes Catholic, serving double-duty as a conduit for Catholic Guilt.)\nThe family where the Beloved Smother lives usually features a Disappeared Dad. The Smother may be a single mother, or the father is a Henpecked Husband; either way, he takes no independent part in raising the child, passing all control to her. The child has no siblings and more often than not is late-born. Bonus points if the Beloved Smother has had trouble getting pregnant or if the child itself has or had some illness to protect from and take care of.\nThe greatest threat however, as percieved by the Smother, lies in the opposite sex. To a son, she will constantly preach that all women are Gold Diggers who are plotting towards a Divorce Assets Conflict, to a daughter - that All Men Are Perverts who will leave her barefoot and pregnant, literally. Any Love Interest that her son may attract will be immediately regarded as a rival for the son's love by the Beloved Smother, and the woman will be belittled, harassed and spied-on to varying degrees of obsession. (Hell, the Smother might actually have been through it herself.) If her son happens to break free and marry the woman he loves, then that unfortunate woman will find herself coping with the Mother-In-Law From Hell, who will be hyper-critical, dismissive and condemning of everything she does to the point where it may even break the marriage apart if her son doesn't do something to curtail his mother's interference.\nIn the most favorable depiction, the Beloved Smother genuinely does love her son and wants him to be happy; she just has a little bit of trouble letting him go, and her plot arc usually revolves around the gradual realization that he's his own man and that she needs to cut the apron strings for his own good (and, usually, hers as well), and that his moving away from her doesn't equal that he doesn't love her in return. At worst, she's a Control Freak Evil Matriarch who will stop at nothing \u2014 not even murder \u2014 to make sure that Mommy's Little Angel remains with her at all costs. For added Squick value, Mommy and Son may be a bit too close in the wrong kinds of ways...\nIt is rarer for daughters in fiction to have trouble with the Smother, but not unheard of; if the girl is unlucky enough to have a Smother, then things will be much the same (although rather than actively preventing their children from having a life outside of her, a Smother who has a daughter will usually instead start badgering her about why they aren't married and providing her with grandchildren on a constant basis). With daughters, however, the dominance may sometimes have an edge of competition as well, as they tend to view their own daughters as rivals. Smothers of daughters are often ex-Alpha Bitches or cheerleaders who tend to bully and harass their daughters into following their footsteps as a way of living their past glories through their children.\nLike most tropes, it's a Truth in Television; Psychiatrist Carl Jung identified this archetype as the Terrible Mother, an over-nurturer who, in smothering her child, ends up stifling them to the point of hampering individuation and personal growth.\nWhen a queen is acting as regent, she often will smother the young king as well, and expect to control the king after he comes of age.\nIf she actually succeeds in taking control of her children, those characters will end up with Mommy Issues.\nMay double up with Safety Worst. May overlap with Meddling Parents and Education Mama.\nCompare/contrast Overprotective Dad and Fantasy-Forbidding Father. If it's a more action based series where the offspring being \"smothered\" is in trouble and the Smother is an Action Mom, see Mama Bear.

Maybe it's the Forbidden Fruit factor: you cannot have them, so, ironically, they become more appealing.\nIf a nun is fetishized, expect her habit to be far shorter and tighter than anything you would see in a real convent. Additionally, most Nuns Are Mikos in anime. Any Church Militant nun, by nature of not only being a nun but an Action Girl, will tend to follow this trope. Because Action Girls are always sexy and such clothing is better suited for combat than a real robe.\nChristian nuns are by far the most common in fiction, but there are Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu nuns too. This trope actually dates back to Middle Ages, as the literature and songs of the time often paint convents as \"houses of vice\" because it was, after all, a building full of women, making this one of the oldest sex and pornography tropes in Western history. (Indeed, in Elizabethan times, \"nunnery\" was slang for a brothel; thus, \"Get Thee to a Nunnery\" in Hamlet is a Double Entendre.) Bear in mind that unlike today\u2014when any nun will have taken her vows voluntarily\u2014medieval noblemen often sent their daughters to convents by force, to keep them away from men until a suitable husband could be found; sometimes, no prospect would appear.\nA Sub-Trope of Nun Too Holy.\nContrast Nuns Are Spooky and Nuns Are Funny.\nDistaff Counterpart of Sexy Priest." }

Cheerleaders are often depicted as outright evil, with the Alpha Bitch as their leader. If the girls aren't evil they might just be Brainless Beauties, following their Alpha Bitch leader out of ignorance or a desire for her approval. The Captain, if not the whole squad, will usually be portrayed as Really Gets Around. From evil to slutty to dumb, any cheerleader in North American media can be expected to be portrayed as shallow and superficial, because popularity is her first and only concern.\nIf a sympathetic, smart character is a cheerleader, she will probably end up quitting the squad as part of her 'growth' (apparently in Hollywood, one can't be a rounded person and remain a cheerleader). A good girl might want to join the squad, but her friend will think that cheerleading is inherently bad and try to stop her, leading to a lesson on how a person should get to do what makes her happy.\nThis trope seems to have weakened slightly in recent years, perhaps due to the popularity of the Bring It On series of films. A sympathetic depiction is still the exception rather than the rule, however. In fact, media with depictions of cheerleaders will often feel the need to go out of their way to explain to the audience (via an outsider POV character like in Hellcats) that cheerleaders can be good people too. Also she needs to be physically strong to lift other players so don't be surprised if her love relation results in Tiny Guy, Huge Girl\nMale cheerleaders are sufficiently rare in fiction that they are usually developed as characters themselves rather than falling under The Cheerleader trope. A good rule of thumb is that if you see a male cheerleader, then cheerleading will be depicted positively, or at least less negatively.\nSee also Jerk Jock, Alpha Bitch and Popular Is Dumb. Contrast with the positive Cute Sports Club Manager. A cheerleader also has a better than average chance of being a Dumb Blonde, but this isn't required. They can be The Fashionista, but often suffer from a Limited Wardrobe: at least during school hours many cheerleaders never wear an outfit other than their uniforms.\nOf course, this isn't Truth in Television. Most cheerleaders are in the squad because they like singing and dancing, and are generally extroverted; bitchiness doesn't exactly mesh well with winning the crowd and teamwork is very important. Competition level cheerleading also requires fitness levels around the same as any other professional athlete and cheerleading is one of the most likely causes of female sports injuries due to the gymnastic stunts performed and lack of protective gear. Anyone performing at that level has the same drive and dedication as any other athlete." }

It becomes a primary goal in their social lives, and success, as measured in the reactions of their peers, is practically an affirmation of their worth as a female.\nAs always, whenever there is a goal like this, there is always someone who overdoes it. The kawaiiko (literally \"cute child\"), or burikko (\"fake child\" or \"pretend(ing) child\"), is the case in point. She takes being kawaii to an almost unhealthy extreme by making it the sole focus of her life. In clothing and fashion, this manifests in frilly, flouncy outfits, often with ribbons and lace. In behavior it appears as a tendency to act childishly \"young\", particularly in speech \u2014 she may speak entirely in baby talk, giggle mindlessly, habitually refer to herself in the third person, and/or use nicknames as well as the -chan Honorific for virtually everyone she encounters. In short, the difference between kawaii and kawaiiko is the difference between \"cute\" and \"cutesy\". (The difference between kawaiiko and burikko, however, is the difference between \"cutesy\" and \"somebody please kill her.\")\nIn some cases, the decision to go kawaiiko is a not a desperate plea for social acceptance but a calculated step intended to further a career goal as an Idol Singer \u2014 for which lacy, frilly cutesiness appears to be required by the Japanese music industry.\nIt would be reasonable to assume that there is some kind of connection between kawaiiko and Lolicon, but the nature of the relationship \u2014 if one does exist \u2014 is not clear.\nCompare Deliberately Cute Child and The Fake Cutie.

This can be \"justified\" any number of ways, but nine times out of ten, it's really for fanservice.\nA very common subtype is the creature that is ostensibly inhuman enough to supposedly not need clothing, like the Zora of the Zelda games, certain Furries or Weres (with or without Non-Mammal Mammaries), or of course, practically any kind of pixie. This subtype is so overwhelmingly commonplace with these inhuman characters that it usually does not come into play at all, making it an Averted Trope.\n... Until they shape shift into a normal human shape for a while, that is. At that point, the character's nudity is a very serious problem that must be addressed, immediately.\nIn a more meta sense, this trope is also frequently used to reveal that the character has an entirely different, unusual mindset:\n The Emotionless Girl and Robot Girl may genuinely not understand what everyone's getting upset about. (Showing a lack of humanity.)\n Raised by Wolves and Raised by Natives characters will simply not understand why nudity is a problem for everyone else. (Showing that she is Closer to Earth.)\n The Green-Skinned Space Babe may feel that people with a nudity taboo are backwards and primitive. (Showing that her culture has Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions.) Alternately, if she is not of the OSSS variety, her people may have a different form of modesty. (Showing a lack of cultural awareness.)\n The local goddess-avatar might not fully understand why this \"nudity\" thing is getting in the way of proper worship, but it had better stop. (Showing a loftier set of priorities.)\n The Sugar And Ice Girl and Genki Girl might not understand why the Childhood Friend is getting upset \u2014 after all, they've been together for years, right? (Showing how close she considers the main character.) As a common evolution of this sub-trope, the first outward symptom of a growing attraction or romantic awareness is when she does start caring that he is watching, or when he begins to become flustered.\nOften such characters are Naked on Arrival; it's not unheard of for a work to use the two tropes together to add a Fanservice Non-Sequitur (or to set up Ms. Fanservice) and then never mention it again.\nSpecial mention goes to \"Feral Children\" stories \u2014 Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan being the biggest ones here, where a character is raised in a situation where they simply don't learn human body shame. In this case, it legitimately is innocent, is depicted for realism or for other reasons necessary for carrying the story, and neither Fanservice nor Freud are anywhere in sight. (Until Disney or or other adaptors make them randomly decide to wear a loin cloth, for some reason.)\nClosely related to Shameless Fanservice Girl, a character without a nudity taboo but who still understands the concept, and Reluctant Fanservice Girl, a character with a nudity taboo thrust into a universe that conspires to make her show as much skin as possible. Our Nudity Is Different is when there is a nudity taboo, but it's different enough that the character is naked by the local standard." }

They are called that because, over the course of history, they have at times been considered an attractive feature. Generally, to be considered attractive, a mole has to be small, not protrude from the person's face, and definitely not have any hairs growing from it. They will usually be either above the lip or below the eye. Fake beauty marks have sometimes been fashionable, especially in the 18th century. Most fake moles were made of silk or velvet, and were sometimes cut into shapes like stars or hearts.\nThis trope is about how facial moles have been handled in fiction, whether they were true Beauty Marks or just plain disgusting moles. There have been dozens of stories resolved because of the discovery of \"the family birthmark\". A common gag in comedies featuring a character with a mole is having it explicitly revealed to be fake, or else have the mole spontaneously move around the character's face between close-ups. Occasionally, the Chosen One has this. And occasionally, just occasionally, the presence of a mole means a skin cancer plot is approaching.\nIn anime, a tragic character will sometimes have a mole near the outside corner of one eye, because in Japan such a mark symbolizes a hard, sad life\u2014the placement calls to mind a tear of sorrow." }

(Is most of the skin sculpted or bulky instead of smooth? Fairchild at right is an excellent example of both \"sculpted\" skin and muscle mass.)

Sometimes starts out as a Super-Strong Child, and usually (if not almost always) is an Action Girl. Almost always has large breasts. Her smaller (and equally dangerous) cousin is the Cute Bruiser. Given that these girls are often tall to further enhance their presentation of strength, romances with them are likely to result in Tiny Guy, Huge Girl and Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy.\nCompare Amazon Chaser where a character finds a woman attractive because of her fighting skills. If he's attracted to her muscles, she's an Amazonian Beauty. Of course, both tropes can be in play at the same time if he's attracted to both.\nContrast Brawn Hilda and Big Beautiful Woman.

Apparently, the other Ashkenazim don't think it applies to them \u2014 not that there are all that many non-Polish Ashkenazim \u2014 and the first-generation Sephardic Jews just saw it as \"isn't that just how all moms are?\" because their Muslim and Christian Arab or Iranian neighbors had the same stereotype.\nSurprisingly, the otherwise northern European Scots suffer... erm... enjoy a variation on this trope with their own mothers. Poles and Russians (and Ukrainians, and Belorussians) are also in the same camp, because, well, Ashkenazi Jews are just as much Poles/Russians as they are Jews.

Even to this day, homemaking is very often perceived by many societies as the natural role for women.\nIn recent years there has been some political and societal backlash against feminist criticism (or at least the most extreme edge of said criticism) regarding traditional roles for women. This backlash may be attributed to the recent decades' progress of the feminist movement and its implications on society, and may be compared to the backlash that took place in postwar America. The backlash could be seen, at least in part, in both the increasing prominence of \"professional\" homemakers such as Martha Stewart, and a rise in Evangelical Christianity which views traditional roles as being conducive to the stability of the traditional family unit and the people therein. However, homemaking is not always a lifetime commitment these days: many homemakers, for economic or personal reasons, return to the workplace, or even Take A Third Option and work from home thanks to the Internet.\nThere's a reason why second-wave feminists were so hard on the concept of the housewife, but you won't see it often on TV. In the postwar era it was common for men to demand, on point of threatening divorce, that their wives never work outside of the home. These guys believed that a working wife was a direct threat to a man's masculinity, since it meant that he obviously didn't earn enough money to support her. It was so bad that in some communities having a wife who worked could label you as an alcoholic who secretly drank his pay away, a homosexual who wasn't man enough to keep his wife at home, or even an abuser who \"forced\" his wife to work. So where does feminism come in? A lot of these same guys later divorced their wives and claimed that they shouldn't pay alimony because their wives \"could just go out and get a job\", forgetting that they had directly prevented them from obtaining any meaningful job experience for the past twenty years. Most of these women couldn't find work that paid more than minimum wage (if at all), yet the men still whined and whined and whined about how they were \"being taken to the cleaners\" by a greedy \"bitch\".\nShe's often a stock character in Dom Coms.

Older Than Feudalism, she appears constantly in legends and folklore around the world, and is the villain of many a Fairy Tale. She seldom appears played straight in modern works, except when they are retelling Fairy Tales, but the number of retold fairy tales (especially \"Cinderella\", \"Snow White\", and \"Hansel and Gretel\") gives her a number of straight appearances. Many psychologists hypothesize that she is an Archetypal Character, devised by children to contain all they hate in their mothers so they can continue to regard Mother as perfect. Sadly enough, Truth in Television; children are vastly more likely to abused by stepparents (and people cohabiting with the parent are even worse). For any or all of these reasons, even decades (centuries?) of subversion have not transformed her even into a Discredited Trope; she can still be played straight or subverted. Shout Outs are commonplace whenever dealing with a stepfamily.\nShe generally favors her own children \u2014 whether from a previous marriage or this one \u2014 over her stepchildren. Not that causes this trope, because it's kind of natural. It's just another symptom. Sometimes her economic motives are made clear: there is only so much to go around, and she wants it for herself or her own children. An equivalent male figure is the Evil Uncle \u2014 because inheritance is generally through the male line, the uncle can inherit his brother's children's estate. Envy is another common cause; the Wicked Stepmother either wants to be Fairest of Them All or to have her daughters be so. A special subtrope deals with those with grown stepsons; she may wish to marry him off to her own daughter, and thus make a victim of her step-daughter-in-law, or she may attempt to seduce him and then accuse him of rape when she fails.\nOn the other hand, the stepsiblings or halfsiblings can but need not be hostile to the hero(ine). If they are hostile, Youngest Child Wins is trumped by the older child's stepchild status.\nThe father is seldom a factor. If not dead (which is common), he will nevertheless never intervene on his child's behalf.\nHer tactics vary widely. She may simply oppress the heroine, keeping her in rags and slaving at household work \u2014 sometimes going as far as assigning the Impossible Task. As a Wicked Witch, she may transform the child(ren) into animals. She may drive or send them off. She may act violently toward them and even kill them (and perhaps cap that by cooking them up and serving them to their father.)\nThe stepchild(ren) may succeed in defeating her through help from their real though dead mother \u2014 the Grimms' version of \"Cinderella\", \"Aschenputtel\", has Aschenputtel get her gowns from the tree planted on her mother's grave. Talking Animals may also feature, as can a Fairy Godmother. These figures can do everything from performing the Impossible Task on behalf of the child to ensuring that She Cleans Up Nicely despite the dirt and rags she is reduced to.\nOn the other hand, writers sometimes Bowdlerise fairy tales by transforming a cruel mother into a wicked stepmother. Grimms' original tales of \"Snow White\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" both featured a cruel mother.\nHer chances of surviving the ending are not good. The Happily Ever After ending of most fairy tales often dwells with more detail on how the Wicked Stepmother and/or her children were punished than on the hero and happiness. On the other hand, stepmothers who are not disposed of often return; when she is not executed at the wedding, she may, for instance, try to kill the heroine when she gives birth and replace her with her own daughter; so the Fairy Tale doesn't end (happily or not) until she's dead.\nSometimes preceded by a Guess Who I'm Marrying? scenario.

Note that the Magical Nanny often becomes a stepmother, but never a wicked one. Department of Child Disservices is a modern organized variation.

What is the first thing you do?\nWell... if you're a woman, the first thing you probably do is use your magic to make yourself look like a Vogue cover model. As villains tend to be defined by their vices, it's only natural then, that female villains would gravitate towards vanity.\nWhile any sorceress who looks over 40 runs the risk of being ridiculed for her less than perfect looks, ancient-looking wizards, Warlocks and male magic users are rarely subject to the same kind of ribbing. They will also be far less likely to fly off of the handle when called \"Old man\" or \"Gramps\", even when they have no grandchildren. Many of them may actually be trying to purposely cultivate the \"wizened old man\" look to inspire respect or get their enemies to underestimate them. It should be noted that some female characters do act this way as well, but they're going for the obvious smartalecky hag gimmick, which only in recent years has become popular enough to be taken seriously.\nThe Vain Sorceress might just be a particular version of the rule that in fantasy stories, all female main characters must appear youthful in appearance regardless of age. This is especially true for female mages who are associated with big strong virile warriors as their tanks; the difference between a good mage and the Vain Sorceress is only about 30% less clothing and 30% more purple dye.\nThe Vain Sorceress' youthfulness is often related to a specific power, where the character has to maintain their appearance by sucking energy from the young \u2014 if not be an outright vampire. Evil sorceresses tend to be far more obsessed with the perfection of their appearance, and go to further lengths to maintain it than good ones will. They may even go so far as to pull a Grand Theft Me, stealing a younger, prettier body to act as the vessel for their soul. In any case, they have to be the Fairest of Them All... by any means necessary.\nIf there's a Black Magician Girl in the hero's party, the Vain Sorceress will mock her unrefined, tomboyish look and intentionally flirt with the hero to make her mad. If there isn't, she'll mock the White Magician Girl's naivete. This again goes back to her vanity: the presence of other, younger females that spend most of their time with the good-looking heroic opposition means that putting them down and preserving her top spot is naturally a high priority.\nThis leads close to being an Always Female trope, as male characters who acts this way are usually depicted as very fey if not outright effeminate. Works that believe All Women Are Vain are just about guaranteed to have at least one Vain Sorceress running around.\nSometimes the Vain Sorceress is the Dark Magical Girl all grown up, so the heroine is the 'good' version. If the protagonist is a young male, this can venture into unintended Freudian overtones.\nIf the Vain Sorceress suffers from the Green-Eyed Monster, she often features as the Fairest of Them All. Usually delights in answering Revenge SVPs.\nNote: this trope doesn't have anything to do with shapeshifting, deceptive illusion, or the more drastic physical changes that a male or female magic user may undergo in their campaign against an enemy. This is strictly a vanity thing. (It's interesting to note however, how much prettier and more human-looking a female mage's monstrous forms are compared to those of a male mage.)\nContrast the Wicked Witch, who is equally villainous but lacks the beauty, and the Hot Witch, who has the beauty but lacks the obsession. If this person is also much older than they seem, then they are Really 700 Years Old.\n\nExamples" }

In the City Mouse, this is part of the luxuries of the city. For the Femme Fatale or The Vamp, it is a calculated part of her scheming. And it can, for any evil blonde, be a symbol of her deception or her lack of simplicity.\nWhen blondes are natural, blondness does correlate with youth (and, presumably, innocence) and so is attractive. Women therefore dye their hair blond. But after a critical mass of blondes have dyed hair, it no longer correlates with youth. And it certainly doesn't correlate with innocence; the honest brunette who does not dye her hair, perhaps because she is not scheming to get a man, appears more innocent. Therefore, blond hair dye falls out of fashion and then blondes are once again mostly natural blondes and so the correlation reoccurs \u2014 restarting the cycle." }

But when a female character's female fan club matches or exceeds her male fan club, you've stumbled upon the slightly rarer but still prominent Distaff Counterpart: Even The Girls Want Her.\nMostly an anime trope (especially in Girls Love works), the \"her\" in question is often an aloof-seeming, athletic high school student who is pursued by every sports club in school, and has the guys crooning \"So hot!\" as she goes past, and the girls squealing \"So cool!\" as she goes past (none of these are a hard-and-fast requirement, but most of the examples will pick and choose at least one or two items off the \"menu\" of aloofness, athletic ability, and \"cool\" beauty). She will often get chocolates from other girls on Valentine's Day (which is Serious Business in Japan).\nThis illustrates the major difference between the gender versions of this trope. The male \"admirers\" in the case of Even the Guys Want Him often mingle equal amounts jealousy, anger, or frustration into their admiration, often due to Stupid Sexy Flanders. But perhaps due to the concept of the Romantic Two-Girl Friendship, the female admirers in the case of Even The Girls Want Her rarely display any negative connotations to their admiration (or attraction). They'll follow the cool girl around like a pack of lovesick puppies, and never think twice about it. The Love Interest of said girl (be male or female) might be more likely to elicit said reactions, though, but that's a case-by-base scenario. Sometimes, though, said love interest becomes the focus of ire of the fan club as he's not worthy.\nThough in some versions, there may be a bit of the Double Standard at work in why females don't seem to bother feeling bad about their crushes or attraction to other girls. In most of the western world, to a great extent a girl finding another girl attractive is \"hot\", while a guy finding another guy attractive is \"totally gay, dude\". May have something to do with female attraction being seen as more \"pure\" or emotionally and/or intellectually based, while of course men just want to jam it in.\nThis refers specifically to otherwise straight women and girls falling for a woman; if her admirers already liked the ladies, it doesn't count.\nMay overlap with Bifauxnen, Cool Big Sis, The Fashionista, Onee-sama, (sometimes) The Ojou, and Aloof Dark-Haired Girl.\nIf her \"admirers\" include much younger characters as well as both sexes, she may be a Stacy's Mom. If the character is intersex, then it becomes Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite.\n\nExamples" }

When a male protagonist needs to consult with or bring in an expert on some obscure and/or technical subject (poisonous orchids, particle theory, rare diseases, ancient languages, prehistoric sharks, whatever), said expert will turn out to be female, drop dead gorgeous, and, at twentysomething, conspicuously too young to have possibly earned the relevant academic degrees or otherwise accrued such expertise (often this is handwaved by mentioning at some point that she was a Teen Genius). Not all of these are required, but the general gist is good enough.\nThe reason why this trope is popular is because men want a woman who can tell them about Lagrange points and do a lap-dance. Preferably both at the same time.\nIf the word \"model\" appears anywhere on The Other Wiki's entry on their actor, you're definitely dealing with one.\nA Hot Scientist is frequently a Hot Librarian as well, and often ends up as a Girl of the Week or Temporary Love Interest. Could be considered an evolution of the Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter, combining the scientist and his daughter into one character (although they tend to be sane). She may also be an Action Girl in a Badass Longcoat.\nFemale protagonists, on the other hand, often get saddled with a Horny Scientist. This trope seems to be increasingly less Always Female, however. In Japanese media, especially the genres aimed at a female audience, expect to see pretty boys with PhDs as well.\nPlease note that this applies to a character, not simply any hot actor playing a scientist, for the same reason Real Life examples are not listed here. Most actors are \"hot\" in the first place, so it usually goes unsaid. You can have an attractive scientist without their hotness being a plot element in the work - that would not fall under \"Hot Scientist\".\nCompare Hollywood Nerd and Nerds Are Sexy.

Characters might make mention of her dating casually, but since that might inflate the cast with unneeded extra male characters this will be implied rather than shown. She'll channel her perverted behavior into playful teasing of the lead guy, or even the other female characters.

If they don't have the flair, this can leave a character gangly and awkward, especially with the Japanese obsession with cute, short women.\nThis installs an enormous physical complex on the character, despite the near guarantee she'll still be quite pretty. Also usually coincides with being the most pectorially developed character. A character who comes to terms with their appearance can become beautiful with enough self-esteem. Without that self-esteem, though, you can wind up with an oversized Shrinking Violet... a Weeping Willow, if you will.\nAlthough this can affect adult women, this trope is much more obvious in high school aged characters; this girl will be obviously taller than her peers, and usually bustier. Otherwise this character can be a tomboy or a domestic type.\nA strangely specific aspect of this trope is the actual measurement, usually 170 centimeters tall (about 5'7\"). While this can seem like less of a big deal depending on what country you're from \u2014 the average female height in America, according to Wikipedia, is around 164 cm (5'5\") using numbers based on self-reported surveys (which contain a lot of heights with shoes on reported), although most medical journals put the average American woman's height at 161 cm or about 5'3\", making this trope make more sense. But judging by how many women wear heels, and the dissonance between surveys and medical journals, it seems that tall women are actually seen as desirable \u2014 this measurement is a huge deal in Japan, where the average female height is 158 cm, or 5'2\", although some medical journals list it as being as short as 156 cm or 5'1\".\nWikipedia has a table listing the average heights of men and women in many different countries. According to that table, the average height for men is consistently 10-15 cm taller (about 4\"-6\") than that of women from the same country. In Japan, a teenage girl of about 170 cm is roughly as tall as an average sized adult Japanese man. In works where it isn't obvious if someone is a huge schoolgirl because there aren't many adult/teenage female characters to compare her to or in settings where average adult heights differ from those in modern Japan, this should be kept in mind.\nOddly enough, although this trope is often in play in teen dramas, \"Hollywood Average\" height for women is around 5'6\" or 5'7\", leading to a bit of a Teens Are Short stereotype that's quite untrue, as adult height is mostly reached by age 14-15 for boys and 12-13 for girls with at most another inch and a half (but usually an inch or less) to be obtained by age 22 for girls and 25 for boys.\nNot to Be Confused with Dawson Casting.

This changed some time after the Industrial Revolution kicked into high gear, when synthetic dyes became the norm rather than the exception. So formerly expensive purple dye was now just as affordable as any other color, and thus lost much of its association with wealth.\nThen as colors began to take on their now-familiar gender connotations, purple found itself increasingly on the feminine side of the gender divide because it was considered a pinker version of blue. This trope is thus a merger of two associations: purple with nobility, and purple with femininity.\nThis color is fairly common to see on a young girl, elderly matron, Spirited Young Lady, or princess (even if Princesses Prefer Pink).\nNow even though this color can be worn by girls of any age, older feminine women are more likely to wear this color long after a girl who wore pink grew out of that color.\nThis also tends to be a popular color among some Mary Sues.\nJust being a woman in purple isn't enough. It has to be a clearly feminine lady.\nA Sister Trope to Pink Means Feminine (and can overlap with colors like fuchsia), True Blue Femininity.\nCompare Purple Eyes, Princess Phase, Winter Royal Lady, Proper Lady, Princess Classic, Princesses Prefer Pink, Purple Is Powerful (and can overlap with some Action Girls), Supernatural Is Purple.\n\nExamples" }

Varying between Cool Big Sis, Emotionless Girl, Little Miss Snarker, and Snark Knight, she marks herself as more experienced and worldly than the other characters, even if the Competence Zone means she herself is barely out of her teens.\nIn fact, she can sometimes fill a mentor role for less experienced and more idealistic characters, all the while loudly expressing her irritation with said arrangement, so no one gets the impression she's softening up. Sometimes, this is to Jerkass levels; however, she is most often a sympathetic Jerk with a Heart of Gold, giving an impression of independent toughness to hide a sincere affection for the other characters.\nThis character was a hero herself once and failed miserably, or maybe she was abused in some way as a kid; whatever the case, her cynicism undoubtedly stems from some traumatic event in her past that destroyed her faith in just about everything. This revelation is normally accompanied by a Freak Out, said past often delivered in a bitter diatribe towards someone who proved a bit too stubborn in their desire to know what it was. At this point, tears are guaranteed, probably more of them the less she's expressed emotion in the past. She also has a 65% chance of engaging in serious physical violence against whoever is closest at the time. This is always treated seriously and Broken Birds have a tendency to be both prone to violence and very good at it, therefore, potential Love Interests should always prepare to be at least slightly maimed during these breakdowns.\nIf she is cured of her emotional torment, expect any of a number of paths. At best, she will continue on as a deeper and less emotionally constipated version of who she was before...but she may also fall prey to Good Is Dumb or mutate into a Satellite Love Interest or Satellite Character. Expect Hope Is Scary on the road to recovery, unless she has an Adrenaline Makeover.\nA number of Romance Novels lean on this trope when the love interest of the heroine is an Anti-Hero with a scar from the past for her to heal. Sometimes involves a bit of that one as well. Women want to Heal the Cutie instead of Break the Cutie.\nThis trope can be summed up as Troubled, but Cute + Dark and Troubled Past.\nPopular with Byronic Hero.

This trope is just a stereotype, mind, and it doesn't require someone actually being - or 'believing' that someone is - a prostitute for it to be brought up.\nThe trope would appear to have its origins in the 1960s and '70s, in the wake of the height of the USA's military-political intervention in Asia. Much of the exposure that US servicemen did have with the locals in Indochina was with prostitutes, as it had been during the Korean War. That films about the war should depict this, along with the endemic black-market trading and drug use, is no surprise. But films of the time also began to include ethnic-Asian characters in stories set in the USA itself, the influx of Vietnamese refugees perhaps serving to highlight the existence of the USA's Asians where before they had been largely ignored.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this trope really came into its own when Asian women were also portrayed as being prostitutes within American society. While this had some basis in reality, it's worth noting that this was virtually the only role in which Asian women were seen for many years, Dragon Lady role aside. This led to an interesting where all Asian women were either conniving kung-fu/wushu temptresses or prostitutes.\nThis isn't as true these days, as portrayals of Indian/Subcontinental and East Asian women tend to show them in more varied roles, even within European societies, but there's still a strong baseline of light-brown-skinned call-girl and streetwalker characters. That south-east Asia and its peoples should continue to be associated with Prostitution in European media is however unsurprising, given the influx of first-world tourists and 'sex tourists' to Indochina during and since America's heavy involvement in the region.\nIf the person doing the stereotyping is...\n ...some sort of non-Asian male, then he may believe the trope and think badly of Asian women - which can get tricky, in a 'bad' way, if they're courting one. Or maybe they just exploit the trope to justify their natural cruelty to their fellow woman.\n ...an Asian male. Indochinese tend to be cool with whatever, but if he's East Asian then he may be out to preserve Neo-Confucian/traditionalnote aka Nineteenth-Century gender roles. He may pressure or even 'bully' fellow Asian females into dating within their race.\n ...a non-Asian woman. Possessed of belief in the stereotype or not, a non-Asian female might well make use of the trope to discredit her romantic rival if she and an Asian are pursuing a non-Asian. If pursuing an Asian female herself, a non-Asian female may well behave as the non-Asian male (see above). Likewise, expect instances of watchful non-Asian mothers \"not being racist\", but just wanting their son/daughter to marry someone who isn't a prostitute.\n ...an Asian woman, then things are a probably a bit complicated. She has to deal with the hangups of the other categories and maybe some Internalized Categorism.\nContrast Yamato Nadeshiko and Ethical Slut.

They have such a strong emotional bond with each other that you'd almost think they're dating. Oh... they are?\nPerhaps it's driven by Wish Fulfillment since Most Writers Are Male and Girl on Girl Is Hot, but there seems to be a lot of attention paid to the idea of two schoolgirls developing feelings of \"forbidden love\" for each other. Or maybe it's just because girls do often form romantic friendships that authors are interested in exploring the logical extreme. Either way, there are a lot of lesbian schoolgirls running around in fiction land. Especially if an All Girl School setting is involved.\nAccording to some sources, this trope may be based in reality, as many girls at old-fashioned all-girls' schools would enter adolescence without any male outlets for their budding sexuality.\nOccasionally, stories focus a bit more on the sexuality and how hot it is that these two young girls are into each other rather than society's reactions. More often, parental and societal disapproval are touched on, but they're generally disregarded in favor of Girl on Girl Is Hot. Unless the work agrees that these relationships are improper, in which case expect Psycho Lesbian to appear.\nIn Japan this trope is a bit more complicated because girls having crushes on other girls is nothing that raises eyebrows in the Japanese school system. The Japanese refer to this as a Class S Relationship, which teaches the young ladies about \"real\" relationships. Class S is not supposed to become physical, and is meant to be outgrown eventually. Retaining a Class S Relationship as one grows older is a sign of immaturity (e.g. immature Clingy Jealous Girls whose lesbian crush has suddenly noticed Boys). Thus, it is not uncommon to find teenage girl-girl relationships in Japanese Media, and they should not be included in this trope unless they explicitly describe themselves as lesbians, or engage in physical intimacy (at least kissing).\nSome works just pretend the girls are together and get out of it later by revealing they're not. Other times writers like to hide behind subtext in a form of Getting Crap Past the Radar.\nFor some reason there's a Double Standard and Schoolboy Gays do not tend to get the same sort of \"it's ok if it's hot\" treatment outside of Fan Fiction and Boys Love Genre.

Also known as a \"real lady\", a \"true lady\", simply a \"lady\", or an \"angel in the house\", she's the perfect lady in the Victorian British mindset. The Proper Lady archetype was widely used in Victorian and earlier literature. Jane Austen was one of the first authors that introduced such qualities to heroines that did not fit into the strictest view of what is acceptable of a Proper Lady, beginning the slow death of this trope. The last time it was seen alive was around the 1950's. Modern ones are likely to be accused of being Purity Sues or have some quirk or flaw that sets them apart from their predecessors.\nA Proper Lady is a gentle yet strong being, incorruptible and pure like the driven snow and Madonna-like in her virtues. She sacrifices herself for the better of her family, religion, and country. She is intelligent enough to smoothly run a household, and wisely spends her husband's money for the better of her family, never guilty of negligence or selfish frivolity. She possesses the wit, taste and esprit necessary to be a star of Society, and never crosses the border of good taste and civility. She is devoted and loyal, never treacherous or scheming. Her manners are never less than impeccable, and her good will and charity are a beacon to those lucky enough to live around her. She is perfectly groomed, likely beautiful or at least comely (while the female antagonist will be more beautiful and appealing). However, more important than her personal looks is her gentle smile. Because small size is endearing (and allows for protective embraces from her lucky husband or fiancé), she will probably be on the shorter side. Chances are that she is an English Rose, especially with dark hair and fair skin. Parasol of Prettiness is a typical prop.\nA Proper Lady might not always be able to defend herself, but should in most cases possess the strength of mind to not panic, and the willpower to never give in to any vile demands.\nShe is always upper class and nearly always married, often a mother. She might also be a redundant woman, in which case she will not be bitter about never getting married, and will instead direct her motherly instincts for the better of her sister's or brother's family. Lower class women and maidens can have many qualities of a Proper Lady, and should, per this trope and the ideals behind it, aim to be as like her as possible.\nThere is no upper age limit to being a Proper Lady. Widowed ladies might easily be double-qualify as Determined Widows. If a lady dies at high age, her death will be dignified, probably caused by old age, and if she dies young (of nothing too unsightly), it will be a heartbreaking tragedy. Her absence will leave behind a great void and she will be dearly missed by not only family members and friends, but also by those who only occasionally had the fortune to be graced with her presence.\nRelated character tropes:\n English Rose - another typically British character with similar properties; popular standard for a Proper Lady's looks\n Graceful Ladies Like Purple - A color showing she's feminine.\n Grande Dame - a rare subtype is a mature Proper Lady; even then, she would still have been a figure of (good-natured) fun even in Victorian times\n The Ingenue - a potential future Proper Lady\n Lady of Adventure: Proper Lady meets Glory Seeker\n Lady of War - Proper Lady or Spirited Young Lady meets Action Girl.\n Princess Classic - princess counterpart\n Silk Hiding Steel - A Proper Lady who is able and willing to take an active role\n Southern Belle - Southern USA counterpart (see bonne belle)\n Spirited Young Lady - a little more witty; a little less prim\n The High Queen - a regent variety\n The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask - Proper Lady meets Iron Lady, add self sacrifice according to taste\n Yamato Nadeshiko - the Japanese (or at least East Asian) version\nOther related tropes:\n All True Ladies Are Free From Carnal Desire\n Hysterical Woman - a lady usually has enough dignity to avert this, although she usually is emotional\n Lie Back and Think of England - originally the only proper way to deal with the wifely duties while not compromising the purity of a lady\n Too Good for This Sinful Earth - if and when she dies, this is probably invoked" }

You can also lose femininity by becoming overly childish and cute. We are talking about a traditionalist grown woman femininity here; The Wife of The Three Faces of Eve.\nKeep in mind that this trope refers to home cooking, not professional cookery. (Although working in a restaurant may still be counted as one of the Acceptable Feminine Goals and Traits depending on how it's presented.) Younger tropers might be surprised to learn that before the 1980s, women were generally not allowed to work as professional chefs. The excuse usually given was that the work was \"too physically hard\" for women, but in reality the common belief was that although a woman could make an adequate home cook, she could never be a real chef, because being a chef took a certain genius that no woman could possibly ever, ever have. The resistance to women working as professional chefs was so strong that some women who tried ended up having to leave the profession to protect themselves from sexual harassment and violence. Thus Colette in Ratatouille can cook and be a fiery feminist heroine at the same time - as she points out, she has to be a fiery feminist in order to become a chef in that time frame at all.\nCompare the male equivalent Manly Men Can Hunt for traditionally male activities in which modern successful men lose the ability to perform manly abilities as a function of their \"sacrifices\" for success.

Frequently, females will be the only ones to have human-like hair, often long and flowing.\nThere may be a reasonable purpose for this: Humans are much more visually oriented than many other animals (except most birds), and these features are the most obvious visual cues for humans in telling female humans from males.

She is the Lad-ette.\nDespite (or perhaps because of) their masculine personalities, Lad-ettes are generally heavily sexualised and are not likely to let any males in the company forget they are female. They usually disdain the hassle of highly elaborately feminine clothing/hair/makeup, but don't often dress in a truly cross-dressing way. They are also generally attractive; a genuinely ugly Ladette is very unusual. Male characters may well be sexually interested in Ladettes for various reasons, whether it's appreciation of their masculine personality and interests, because they don't disapprove of laddish behaviour, or simply because of their assumed willingness to engage in casual sex.\nSometimes, this woman's personality is explained by her having grown up with brothers or been raised as a boy.\nAlso note that The Lad-ette in fiction not uncommonly winds up dropping her lifestyle in favour of something more conventional. It is difficult to tell whether this is Truth in Television or not, given how relatively recent the character type is, but there is probably at least an element of wishful thinking at play.\nCompare and contrast with other tropes about women who look/behave in a traditionally \"masculine\" way: the Tomboy (she might have been one when young); Bifauxnen (where the girl can effectively pass as a male - though ironically while lacking most of the 'masculine' behaviour of the Ladette); Pirate Girl; and her grandmother, who shares her mannerisms and points of view, yet retains the femininistic image: The Flapper. Also compare with the Butch Lesbian, with which this trope may or may not overlap. If that hot girl is acting like a guy because she's not 100% girl, it's a case of Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite.

This latter technique is called the Beer Goggles effect. (\"She's a 2 at 10 but a 10 at 2\")\nThis technique has been somewhat less common since Moonlighting left the airwaves, having caused a critical shortage in the world supply of soft focus.

Some suggest that with the inception of High Definition film and television, which naturally shows more imperfections; that the Soft Focus trick might make a return to compensate.\nThis may come from a practice in the early days of film making when a piece of gauze, a sheer stocking, or Vaseline was placed over the lens of the camera to blur the image of the actresses and hide imperfections on the face. Popularized by the fabulous Carole Lombard, who spent her time in the hospital after suffering a serious facial injury devising ways in which she could hide her eventual scar. If she didn't invent the Gaussian blur, she knew the person who did.\nA more limited, so to speak, application of the technique was used during the days of The Hays Code to make sure that women in low-cut dresses weren't displaying their cleavage in too much detail, thus corrupting innocent youth. A limited portion of gauze or stocking, held in a frame, could be used to blur the \"offending\" anatomy and render it suitable for viewers.\nHas nothing to do with Gauss guns.

The ones who weren't were left by the wayside. Thus women leaders are generally portrayed as trying to demonstrate their iron will at all times. Indeed, they have to lest they lose all credibility.\nMind you, it's not that she's all iron. In private, she can be quite warm, even loving. Seeing as the camera can take us anywhere, we often get to see it. However, her public does not.\nThe model for this in the contemporary world is Margaret Thatcher, who was beyond iron to somewhere around titanium towards her (entirely-male) cabinet, and defines the \"presidential Premiership\" in British politics even more than Tony Blair.

Compare with Proper Lady, which provides the Iron Lady some foundation. Compare Silk Hiding Steel, where her iron disposition is hidden beneath smiles and Passive-Aggressive Kombat.\nCompare/contrast Evil Matriarch and Grande Dame. Also contrast her possible opposites Stepford Smiler, Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher, and Cute and Psycho, all of whom are more prone to using emotion to get what they want rather than setting it aside as the Iron Lady does.\nIf she is royal, see The High Queen, God Save Us from the Queen!, and/or The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask. For her typical Evil Counterpart, see The Baroness. May well have been a Go-Getter Girl when younger. The Lady of War is a comparable action-ready variant (and can overlap each other if she's active both in the field of battle and politics simultaneously) as well.\nNot to be confused with Iron Maiden.\nFor the 2011 movie about Margaret Thatcher starring Meryl Streep, see The Iron Lady." }

Wouldn't Hit a Girl may come into play as well; the simple fact that she isn't mown down like all the other Mooks may help her make up her mind that the side of good isn't so terrible after all. In other cases she's Good All Along but was initially attracted by the villain's charms before getting in over her head.\nThe reason this trope exists is a combination of Beauty Equals Goodness plus the Double Standard that women cannot be truly evil. For the same reason, a female villain typically has to go above and beyond her male counterparts before the audience will accept her as irredeemable. The flipside to this is the Unfortunate Implications of the male sex being more evil than that of the former villainess.\nBeing unattractive is another surefire way to keep a female baddie on the side of evil, as is being overly sexual; The Vamp is an unlikely candidate for redemption because she's usually the one attracting the men, not vice versa.\nCompare Females Are More Innocent and Women Are Wiser.

Red clothing is also associated with prostitutes, chorus girls and other dancers, and other women attempting to be sexy.\nThis trope is about the character type, not the dress itself.

A Lady in Red is sexy. She might be morally ambiguous but she mostly displays a form of sexual availability, a signal that she's ready to fulfill a guy's sexual desires. The Woman in Black may be sexy and enticing but, in sharp contrast to her crimson counterpart, she is also openly menacing and sexually unavailable, especially if her outfit covers her whole body. In any case, the Woman in Black clearly conveys that approaching her is not a good idea, whereas the Lady in Red means to arouse lust.\nCompare The Little Black Dress, Pink Means Feminine.\nPlease note, that according to Chinese mythology, a woman who dies in a red dress, or commits suicide in one, is able to come back to haunt those who wronged her, which leads to a multitude of ladies in red dresses in Hong Kong horror movies.

The story has become so ingrained into Western culture that any time we see a little girl dressed in a red hooded coat on television, it is reasonable to expect that something terrible is going to happen to her.\nHowever, given the popularity of the Fractured Fairy Tale, it was inevitable that this story would recieve modern updates. Modern versions of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" tend to have a feminist vibe, making her tough, streetwise, and able to take care of herself, thank you very much. This updated version will almost always be named \"Red.\"\nA popular, Grimmified variant is to give her a gun, an axe or some other weapon and have her hunt down the \"wolf\" (Who may or may not be a literal wolf) herself. This variant will feature a teenage or adult Red, who will naturally be Hotter and Sexier, making her double as a Lady in Red. (Bonus Points \u2014 can anyone find a version that has her say \"What big eyes you have\" just before she shoots someone?)\nA more subtle version simply has a young woman entering a dangerous situation dressed in a red jacket, seemingly to invoke Little Dead Riding Hood, only to then subvert it by revealing her toughness. This lacks the Narmy vibes of the other works, as the Fairy Tale Motif is limited to the coat only.\nNote that, despite the title, Red does not always have to be an Action Girl to qualify as this trope. Any subversive, \"updated\" version of the character who is shown to be capable of taking care of herself is valid.\nSee also: Lady in Red, Fairy Tale Motifs, Fractured Fairy Tale, Grimmification, Little Dead Riding Hood, Bring My Red Jacket and Xenafication.\n\nExamples" }

For some reason they draw the eye and attention. Often it's because they are The Woobie and so the Hero decides to protect her or help her on her quest. She often serves as a Call to Adventure.\nMost often she's of royal birth, or a goddess in disguise. Sometimes unknowingly. But occasionally you'll just have a common birth waif.\nThere are two key parts.\nFirst, she's a \"waif\". It's usually a she, but sometimes a young boy might fill the role- in this case the hero is likely a heroine.\nTo quote the other wiki: \"The word waif (from the Old French guaif, stray beast) refers to a living creature removed, by hardship, loss or other helpless circumstance, from his or her original surroundings. The most common usage is to designate a homeless, forsaken or orphaned child, or someone whose appearance is evocative of same.\"\nSo she's somehow been removed from her normal routine and can't go home for some reason. (This is where The Woobie bit comes in).\nThe second is that she's mysterious. We (and the hero) usually don't know much about her past, at least until The Reveal at the end. But for some reason we are drawn to her. She's mysteriously alluring- partly because of the mystery around her. Where did she come from? Why can't she go home? Why won't she tell us about these things? (She's usually scared and doesn't want to talk about her past). A Mysterious Waif is frequently visually distinct from the other characters in some way and likely to double as an Oracular Urchin because odd, fey personalities are common with this trope and making cryptic remarks that only raise more questions goes hand in hand with the Mysterious part of Mysterious Waif. Outright Psychic Powers, or being so good at reading people that you might think they're psychic, are also frequently found in Mysterious Waifs.\nBefore you know what is happening the hero is getting caught up in trying to help her without really knowing what is happening or what he's getting into. (Expect him to have a serious moment of doubt once he discovers he's gotten into something big and dangerous.) Often involves a Big Brother Instinct aspect.\nParticularly common in the RPG genre for video games. This character often has other additional elements of appearance and gameplay. See the subtrope Mystical Waif for more details about this variant.\nSee also Waif Prophet, Oracular Urchin. Mysterious Woman is usually sexy instead of Moe. Subtrope of Mysterious Stranger." }

        "comment": { "type": "literal" , "xml:lang": "en" , "value": "Brawn Hilda is, essentially, a strong, mannish, usually foreign woman (particularly German, Russian, or Scandinavian). However, she's not an Amazonian Beauty, her strength is seen as unattractive, as she usually (purposely or not) emasculates the hero by beating him up or outdoing him in \"manly\" activities (such as arm wrestling, boxing, hot dog eating, pretty much anything unfeminine really...) She usually has a thick stereotypical accent, has a masculine face, and is often a stereotypical female immigrant (maid, mail-order bride, etc....) or some sort of hardcore Olympic-esque athlete. Basically, the Brawn Hilda is the Fat Girl on steroids.\nHer personality can run from motherly but overprotective to gruff and cantankerous, but the vast majority of the time her personality is irrelevant: she's just a gag character whose humor stems from being the opposite of a hot exotic chick. In one Stock Plot, for example, Bob books \"Ekaterina\" as his masseuse or cleaning woman, expecting someone young and attractive, and gets this character instead, who violently rearranges his house and life (and, if a masseuse, also causes him considerable personal discomfort). In more serious contexts, she tends to turn into The Rosa Klebb version of The Baroness. Bonus points if she's blond, wears braided twin tails, and possesses the name Helga, Hilda, or Olga (which is the Russian version of Helga!).\nOf Course, both in Real Life and in-universe, you can always expect someone to demonstrate Rule 36. In universe examples, whether a male Badass has finally found the other half of his Battle Couple or simply a Chubby Amazon Chaser has found his dream girl, may even be played as a Crowning Moment of Heartwarming as Hilda finds someone who truely appreciates her for all of her qualities.\nIf a cave woman is not a Nubile Savage, she will probably be this instead. Contrast with the Fat Girl, who is large, but probably not athletic; with Amazonian Beauty, when she's attractive because of her masculine traits; with The Baroness, who is the classic East European Femme Fatale; with the Big Beautiful Woman, whose bulk is considered attractive in and of itself, and who is often non-European. Compare No Guy Wants an Amazon, when this keeps her from finding a man; and Butch Lesbian, if she likes the ladies instead. See also Lady Looks Like a Dude.\nThe trope name is a reference to the Icelandic queen Brunhildnote whose name means \"the hill of battle\" in the German epic Das Nibelungenlied, the Trope Codifier, if not Trope Maker, for such characters. In the story she challenges men who attempt to wed her into warlike games, throws boulders with ease, and even ties her own husband up and hangs him on the wall. These traits, combined with the large women who usually play her in operatic adaptations, have led people to commonly assume she's an unattractive, mannish woman, even though the story actually describes her as more akin to the The Lad-ette trope. Big women (like Frieda Leider, Birgit Nilsson, and Jessye Norman), however, play her in the operas because they're usually the only ones with the vocal vigor to take on Brünnhilde's role. \"It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings\" is likely a reference to Brünnhilde's famous (and memetically glass shattering) immolation scene in Richard Wagner's Götterdämmerung adaptation of the story, fully capable of making a lesser woman simply collapse under the effort- in essence, to sing the part of Brünnhilde you have to be a Brawn Hilda.\n\nExamples" }

The French Maid will speak with an over-exaggerated French accent and use Gratuitous French.\nContrast to Meido, which is a Japanese concept developed from this one.

As a sort of compromise, they often introduce a high-ranking female at the end of her career. The (male) protagonist meets her briefly, probably mentioning her former achievements as he does so, and then she politely vacates the spotlight so that the boys can get on with things, her pride and former glory intact. Depending on the cultural background of the work, her retirement may be less about age or ability and more about leaving to start a family. In these cases, she may make a speech about how a woman's place is in the home, and everyone will applaud her departure into domesticity. (If she is leaving to take a promotion or a transfer, this trope does not apply.)\nUnfortunately, there's also a more misogynistic, Writer on Board variation. These will have the woman demoralised to make a point, and that point is that women aren't made to rule. Either she screws up badly and gets fired or demoted, or she's completely overruled and undermined by a male character who automatically assumes control of the situation through no qualification other than having a Y-chromosome. She will either immediately accept this and take on a more stereotypically female role (most likely The Chick), or protest this demotion and be punished by the plot. Expect her to become a love-interest whether she likes it or not.\nThis can sometimes be the official form of Chickification, since the reduction in rank is often accompanied by a reduction in ability or effectiveness (making you wonder how she got promoted in the first place). If she stays in the story, the focus often shifts away from her career and more towards her emotional and romantic life.\nNote that not all female characters who get demoted fit into this trope - this is for examples where sexism (either in-setting or by the writer) is clearly the primary factor. Quickly Demoted Leader when gender-neutral circumstances create the same problem.\nCompare Hysterical Woman, which may go hand in hand with this trope." }

This is not to be confused with Oujo, which means \"princess\" or \"queen\"; ''ojou'' has the accent on the second syllable rather than the first.\nThis means that while she is often rich, and occasionally even an actual Blue Blood, the key point is that other people treat her like royalty, whether or not she actually is. Sometimes an Ojou can actually attain her status simply by personality alone (often in high school settings where she is probably a School Idol), by being so heavily idolized that a fanclub springs around her, elevating her to a status far above that of those around her, while leveling violent reprisals against any who would treat her as a commoner. Oftentimes, a wealthy Ojou is found in a leading role in the Absurdly Powerful Student Council. In fact, her wealth is often the Hand Wave explanation for the absurd power: they make the rules because they have money.\nMost Ojou characters can be boiled down to three main types, a Proper Lady variety, an Ice Queen variety and a Royal Brat variety. See the Analysis For This Page to see how those three types tend to play out.\nThough together for the purposes of this entry, the ojou, or daughter of a high-society family, is written with distinctly different kanji than the oujo, or princess (literally \"lord's daughter\"). In Japanese, expect all types of ojou to use the more formal first-person pronoun \"watakushi\" rather than the more casual (and feminine-only) \"atashi,\" and to make heavy use of the \"wa\" feminine emphasis particle at the end of their sentences.\nA staple feature of these characters are to have Ojou Ringlets, Regal Ringlets, or a Hime Cut for a hair cut and for the Royal Brat type a Noblewoman's Laugh.\nA character saying \"oujo-sama to oyobi\" (roughly, \"Call me queen\") implies something else entirely.\nSee also Princely Young Man for the Spear Counterpart of this trope.

It's also very popular in the comments sections of car accident videos on sites like YouTube.\nThere is a slight dose of Truth in Television to this: due to evolutionary reasons women tend to have slightly worse spatial reasoning skills than men, but men however more than make up for this by risky behavior. Statistically speaking, women are more likely to scratch your car on the parking lot, men are more likely to drive past a red light and into you at 100kmph. Women have slightly more accidents but those tend to be far less serious than men's. In locales where insurance companies are allowed to give different premiums for men and women, women's premiums will be less than men's as the overall cost to the insurance company of covering women is actually lower than the equivalent men. And many women, especially women with commuter jobs, hate driving - they may do it out of sheer necessity, but for many women the men's reckless love for cars and driving appears somewhat psychotic. This also occurs in poorer societies where the average family has only one car and the fathers tend to log most of the wheel-time. Also, from the late 1940s to roughly the mid 1960s, women did tend to be poorer drivers than men of the same age, simply because they usually learned later in life, from poorer instructors (their husbands, rather than professionals), and until the two-car family became commonplace, had less opportunity to practice, as noted previously. Also, before power steering became universal, driving required a certain amount of upper-body strength. Even during that period, though, this trope was at best a considerable exaggeration of the actuality.\nThe trope has been somewhat replaced by Drives Like Crazy, in which the driving is the joke, rather than the womanhood. See Directionless Driver for another gender-based driving stereotype." }

(After all, how else do you end up with all those Naughty Nuns?) Any accurate resemblance to reality is purely accidental.\nAs Roman Catholicism teaches that sex is to be strictly reserved as part of marriage, it is widely believed that children in Catholic families are not taught about sexuality in a way that promotes an informed understanding of themselves and their world. This feeds into an idea that since they supposedly know nothing of these things, seducing them would be a lot easier than seducing more 'enlightened' girls who 'know better'.\nAlternatively, even those who know differently may feel that a Catholic girl striving to be innocent is a desirable virgin, who is a greater challenge to seduce, and thus a \"greater prize\" if she caves under pressure. Or else there's the notion (sometimes Truth in Television but more often wishful thinking, given the fetish-fantasy nature of the trope) that a seemingly chaste schoolgirl may only be going through the motions of chastity and religiosity for the benefit of parents and teachers, similarly to another trope somewhere around here, and is just itching for a chance to reveal her less-than-religious side the moment no one's looking. All that repression leading to a simmering cauldron of typical teenage hormones just looking for a chance to boil over in a plethora of exciting ways in an attempt to rebel.\nAnd of course for some there's good old nostalgia, as plenty of Catholic school alumni can fondly remember their own hormonal teenage years. Alternately, those who actually attended a Catholic school may be much less prone to this trope: seeing a uniform (especially one involving skirts and dress shirts) on both attractive and unattractive girls, possibly even one's own family members, for years on end tends to make one lose interest in the uniform rather quickly.\nRegardless of the (admittedly squicky) reasoning behind it, the trope has led to the fetishization of the standard \"school girl uniform\", Catholic or otherwise, frequently modified to Stripperiffic specifications. This outfit usually consists of a button-up shirt, sometimes worn with a tie (in more exploitative media, the shirt is worn without a bra, and knotted so high up that the girl in question is simultaneously baring her midriff completely and showing off a lot of cleavage); usually a blazer or jacket of some kind, frequently a couple of sizes too small; a short, pleated skirt that may or may not be in some kind of plaid; knee-high socks or stockings; and often pigtails. Expect panty shots to be a frequent occurrence (if she's wearing any). Needless to say, any girl who actually shows up to class like this would be thrown in detention faster than you can say \"Jailbait.\" The uniform will sometimes be depicted as being worn even outside of school.\nWhen this outfit shows up in films and TV shows, it's almost always done through Dawson Casting. Likewise, when it's done by fully-grown women, it's almost always a case of Fanservice in action.\nIn Britain, where the trope is not associated with Roman Catholicism to the same extent (due to uniforms being much more common in both public and state schools), this look is known as the \"St. Trinian's Girl\", after a series of Boarding School movies by that name. Related, but not identical, to the sailor-suited Japanese schoolgirl fetish, Joshikousei. This is slowly becoming a Discredited Trope now.\nSlowly becoming part of the \"once common but no longer generally required\" subtrope of Hollywood Dress Code, since many real Catholic schools have changed their uniforms to unisex khakis and polo shirts, especially as more schools realize that what looks pure and innocent on a 9 year old takes on a different context (whether intentional or not is irrelevant) when worn by a 17 year old after the \"summer growth spurt.\"\nCompare and contrast the Preacher's Kid.\nA subtrope of Adults Dressed as Children." }

Note that the term may be used interchangeably with 'seifuku', which means any general \"school uniform\", but is often used to describe the sailor outfits in particular. Although seeraafuku are not as common now in Japan as they once were, the vast majority of anime girls still wear them.\nThat Japanese has such a compact, productive phrase for this image implies that it's an important archetype in the Japanese psyche, and this is borne out by how often sailor-suited school girls still appear in both manga and anime.\nSee also School Swimsuit, for when the girls wear something that shows a little more skin.\nThis is mainly a Japanese cultural trope but is found prominently in anime. The Western equivalent is Catholic School Girls Rule. However, given that many Japanese high schools have abandoned the sailor uniform, which nowadays is a characteristic indicator of middle school girls, more professional-esque styles of uniform have become a popular replacement - popular not just among schools but also among viewers - so the two are beginning to merge. Joshikousei are very prominent in anime/manga, to the point where the far majority of female characters will be either be high school girls or at the very least be in the same age group (should high school not exist or should their occupation prevent them from going to school). In fact, one of the main reasons why most male protagonists are ordinary highschool students is so they can be surrounded by high school girls.\n\nExamples" }

These are the women whose overall charm comes from their height. Even if they themselves don't acknowledge it, the story and/or characters make it clear that her height is one of her distinguishing charms. Also, in fiction, tall women tend to be Tomboys and sometimes fall into the Action Girl archetype. Due to their extreme height, they will often have nice, long legs.\nThey are also quite common in the Superhero genre, where they also often have a Heroic Build and the Most Common Superpower. As with those tropes, tall heroines can be more the norm than the exception. Tall heroines have to be extremely tall to really stand out. Looking at published Canon references like DC's Who's Who and Marvel's Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, one gets the impression that the average height for female heroes is something like 5'10\" or 5'11\" (and that for male characters, it's about 6'3\").\nPlease note that for a woman to qualify for this trope, she needs to fulfill two criteria:\n She must be either taller than most men in her setting or stand at least 5'8\" (172 cm) tall.\n She must either be considered attractive in-universe or be accompanied by Fanservice, Beauty or Attraction Tropes. note For example, Stripperiffic, Male Gaze, She Cleans Up Nicely, Amazon Chaser, etc.\nNot to be confused with Taken for Granite.\nSome Statuesque Stunners are also Amazonian Beauties.

The only options are to throw off your frilly dress and to run off with the first hero who passes through (in old fashioned stories), or set off for Action Girl adventures on her own on the sly (in the modern ones).\nThe Rebellious Princess is usually a teenager, typically brash (since it goes hand in hand with being rebellious), and often blonde and/or has a Tomboyish Ponytail.

Thus the seashell bra was invented to preserve the modesty of female merfolk everywhere. You probably think this originated with Disney's The Little Mermaid, but Disney was using it all the way back in 1953 to depict the mermaids in Peter Pan (although they looked distinctly less bra-like in those days). Expect bras to also be made out of other marine trappings, such as starfish (though glomping a living creature to one's own body doesn't sound like a good idea in hindsight \u2014 especially if it ejects its stomach and starts digesting your nipples) or perhaps seaweed or other vague underwater flora, though the shells are often depicted as somehow clinging magically without any accompanying harnesses or straps, seaweed or otherwise. Also, the bra will almost always be made from scallop shells rather than clam, oyster, conch, or nautilus shells◊ (not unless they are hollowed out).\nOf course, not every culture shares the notion that the sight of female nipples somehow corrupts children, hence the Japanese animated version'' of the classic Hans Christian Anderson tale features bare-chested mermaids.

In the days of The Hays Code, once those sweaters caught on, they were almost up there with the heart-shaped neckline as a way of Getting Crap Past the Radar. Actresses who embraced this look were known as sweater girls, hence the trope name.\nNot that a sweater can never be tacky. It's just if ladies want to look sexy, and the choice is between a halter top or an angora sweater, the latter is far less likely to have the wearer say, \"Just because I'm wearing these clothes doesn't make me a prostitute!\" It's more the \"I'm way out of your league,\" kind of sexy. Particularly fuzzy sweaters can emphasize this by subtly echoing the glamour of a fur coat.\nA special note as there is cultural differences, in Asia countries, school girls(and even boys) wear a sweater to cover up their developing figure, especially when they are growning to be more mature and starting to show differences in their bodies. So it is not uncommon to see school girls and boys wear sweaters when it is 30 degrees Celsius or higher. This has nothing to do with sexiness, and the wearers actually want the opposite.

Older yamato nadeshiko are better at this, while a younger one will make up for it in determination \u2014 especially when it comes to the man she loves, because that trumps everything else. Remember: this is just a trope, and all Tropes Are Tools.\nA poorly done yamato nadeshiko will turn out like an Extreme Doormat. They are silent and submissive without the inner strength of a true yamato nadeshiko. This is a common stereotype of East Asian women in Western fiction and is often referred to derisively as the China Doll stereotype.\nWith some notable exceptions, yamato nadeshiko will be of medium height, willowy, modestly endowed, and good-looking without being too beautiful or too cute; they will have pale skin and long dark hair with full, straight bangs and side-bangs. They'll dress in feminine fashions: skirts, blouses, low-heeled shoes, lace, ribbons and simple hair ornaments. The other option is impeccable lady-like style for adults. A kimono is likely to be worn by a nadeshiko brought up in the good old Kyoto style. Some may wear jewellery and make-up, but not too much. Their voices will often be gentle, calm, and warm as melted butter. Large, rounded eyes are always a good bet. It is not unusual for geisha to be a yamato nadeshiko.\nSometimes, these ladies will also know self-defense, even if they would rather not fight if it can be avoided. This makes sense as many nadeshiko came from samurai clans and thus were trained in fighting so they could defend their homes whenever the males were absent. If that's the case, they'll be very graceful and effective in the battlefield, and they're likely to be White Magician Girls or Barrier Warriors. If they're neither, they'll likely use polearms, lances (specifically naginata which daughters of samurai families were traditionally trained in and included in their dowry) or bow/arrows, and maybe even small tantou daggers that may be hidden in their clothes.\nThese characters pop up a lot in Magical Girlfriend series (usually as the one who will win the male lead's heart) and as the \"Betty\" in Betty and Veronica Love Triangles. They tend to be very sympathetic, but their passive, reactionary nature puts them in danger of becoming Satellite Characters for more \"interesting\" people, as well as target of bashing from fans who prefer more active love interests such as Tsundere. Obviously, this trope is most popular in Japan.\nExpect her name to end in \"-ko\" [子] or \"-mi\" [美], which mean \"child\" and \"beauty\", respectively.Protip \"-ko\" in words is analogous to the Western suffix \"-ette\"/\"-elle\"/\"-ine\" in making any name feminine. Less subtle examples might even use Nadeshiko for the Meaningful Name factor.\nYou will sometimes find males who fit in the yamato nadeshiko role, personality and/or looks-wise (like Japan in Axis Powers Hetalia, obviously), but this is still rare. The true Spear Counterpart to this trope is Samurai.\nMore information on this concept can be found in the sci.lang.japan FAQ. Compare Stepford Smiler for and Yandere for a girl who seems to be a Yamato Nadeshiko but hides a far more unstable psyche. Her sort-of early Western equivalent is the Determined Widow. A more passive Victorian era Western equivalent is the \"angel in the house\" or as we call it, Proper Lady. An attempt to take this trope's appealing traits Up to Eleven while still playing it straight runs the risk of producing a Purity Sue.\nThis trope is commonly used in the portrayal of a Patient Childhood Love Interest character's personality.\nCompare English Rose and Proper Lady (her UK counterparts), Silk Hiding Steel, Spirited Young Lady, Princess Classic, Southern Belle (her US counterpart), The Ingenue, Dandere.\nNote: This trope is for the Japanese Ideal in particular and Eastern Asian Ideal in general. For the western/European ideal see Proper Lady. For a general 'proper on the outside, powerful on the inside' woman use Silk Hiding Steel. For tropes describing homemakers and housewives in general, use House Wife. To describe 'innocence' or 'gentleness' use The Ingenue. Polite or friendliness can be covered by Nice Girl. A person whose niceness belies danger/effectiveness use Beware the Nice Ones. General girliness is covered by Girly Girl.\n\nExamples" }

More or less, the Asian equivalent of a Dumb Blonde.\nThe idea is this: you have Alice, who is of some East Asian ethnic group or another, usually the princess of an affluent immigrant business (or crime) family. (many of the examples are rather specifically Chinese, with a distinctly Chinese last name) Alice is beautiful, photogenic, popular... but she's also vain and petty and dumber than a box of hair. Used as the de facto villain or the Alpha Bitch most of the time or if not as the dim witted sidekick for a major character, she is almost always contrasted by other characters who are demonstrably smarter, more capable, and less easily manipulated. Never the main character but sometimes a sympathetic one, Alice will at best be reduced to a running gag, and at worst portrayed as a villain.\nThe stereotype occurs in two types:\n Type One: \"The Tipton\", with the character from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody being the most prominent example. This is the combination of the Alpha Bitch with this stereotype: A pretty, popular, usually rich Asian girl fawned after by boys but presented as being vain and petty at the same time. Often played by Brenda Song.\n Type Two: \"The Cutie\", a more benign, less in-your-face version of this with the Alpha Bitch qualities largely or totally removed. This leaves only the looks, money and popularity, and the stupidity which is made more excessive. The character in this case is neither unattractive nor unpopular, nor is she socially inept, so to make her bad qualities obvious she is made functionally retarded, easily manipulated and largely incapable of handling herself without assistance (usually from a Caucasian male main character).\nNote: male examples of this are tremendously rare. It is almost Always Female.\nCompare Valley Girl. Often the preferred type of Asian girls of fictional White guys.\nFrequently a side effect of Ability over Appearance and Type Casting. In many cases, the character was likely not intended to be Asian; however, they could come across an actress who plays the character perfectly, with the fact that she's Asian merely incidental. The aforementioned Brenda Song is a good example. On Suite Life, the character was an obvious Expy of Paris Hilton, and was originally supposed to be played by co-star Ashley Tisdale. However, Song was revealed to have a natural knack for playing the airhead, so she and Tisdale swapped roles.\nContrast with the usual \"nerdy\" portrayal of Asians in media, which this trope subverts, and Dragon Lady. Also contrast The Ojou, who generally tends to be smart and rich (and usually pleasant in personality.) Compare to Brainless Beauty (Type Twos), the Alpha Bitch and Rich Bitch (Type Ones).\n\nExamples" }

One unfortunate one is that Tomboys are depicted as \"better\". This might be because Most Writers Are Male, or because Girls Need Role Models, but either way it seems to be a way of saying \"see, our Princess is a role model for modern girls\". Expect there to be several girly traditional Princesses for contrast. Occasionally both the Tomboy and the Girly Princess might learn to appreciate each other in spite of their differences. In these types of uses the Tomboy Princess is used to tell An Aesop about gender roles. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it doesn't overwhelm the character and story.\nA more moderate approach is to use the \"Tomboy Princess\" as a way to combine the Tomboy and Girly Girl into one character. Who says tomboys can't be girly? Who says girly girls can't be tomboys? This has the advantage of appealing to a lot of girls who both want to play with the boys, but also like wearing tiaras and fancy dresses (also showing that She Cleans Up Nicely). These Tomboy Princesses are usually too busy being awesome to bother with trying to teach Aesops. Although occasionally they'll have a Very Special Episode to teach one. The most common pitfall for a writer with this type of Tomboy Princess is having her become too awesome.\nThose are the most common forms of the Tomboy Princess, but there are other uses. For example, a Princess might be made a Tomboy so as to make her more down-to-earth than the rest of the nobles. In this case the focus is more on class roles rather than gender roles.\nCan also overlap with a Rebellious Princess.

She'd never say something like \"I Broke a Nail\".\nWhen introduced, she might proceed to beat the crap out of the biggest boy (who probably made some comment about how girls are too weak or girly to play with) to make sure everyone understands that she's one of the boys and not expecting any special treatment. Of course, because of the Double Standard and Wouldn't Hit a Girl restraints she usually is treated differently, but not as much as other girls.\nUsually a Tomboy, and often subject to a She Cleans Up Nicely in a Beautiful All Along plot, but unlike other girls she protests and is upset about the event, considering herself a victim as being forced to wear a dress is humiliating, and she probably looks pretty nice already. Not to mention it undermines all the work she put into getting the boys to accept her as one of them. Often following such an event she has to beat one of the boys up all over again.\nIn a strange twist, Chickification is often seen as an improvement for this character. The boys she hangs with often find the development of feminine attributes in their best friend a positive development as they now have an approachable girl who also has a lot in common them. Other times her Tomboyish ways backfire on her when her friends who are boys get to a dating age, and all come to her expecting advice on how to court their latest crush.

It's what happens to a Shrinking Violet, or a Girl Next Door who finds herself embroiled in an adventure situation. It is most common in movies, but has been known to turn up in other media.\nThe Adrenaline Makeover candidate is almost always or was Beautiful All Along. But at the beginning of the story, our heroine is mousy, shy, wearing the bad glasses, the frumpy clothes, etc.\nSometimes she's secretly, unknowingly, the Hot Librarian, or a case of late blooming gorgeous. Sometimes they're gorgeous but shy, or otherwise mild-mannered because they have to work twice as hard to be thought of as half as good in a male-dominated field; and being sexy equals not being taken seriously; and being aggressive is considered a negative trait for a female \u2014 at least, in this part of the story. Less frequently, she's a teenager going through this, which results in I Can't Believe a Guy Like You Would Notice Me at some point during the transformation.\nThe usual progression of the trope has the character starting out blinded to the world by their academic pursuits. She's in trouble that she needs assistance to get out of, resulting in a hero showing up and helping her through an epic adventure. The adventure distracts her from maintaining her frumpiness; the hero is there to rescue her, to help her de-frump, and to fall in love with her, making her realize as she returns his affections that if she'd just shaken out the hair and dumped the glasses before, she might have gotten a hot hero guy that much sooner.\nBy the end of the movie, she's come out of her shell, cast off her shyness, and come into her own in her own field. She takes a level in badass, amps all the way up to Action Girl, and joins the guy in his field, and they become a Battle Couple.\nThis often happens to make The Chick more palatable to men (and sometimes, \"more exigent\" females), and to add that romantic element so that action movies can also be date movies. The recipient of the Adrenaline Makeover is almost Always Female, though a Non-Action Guy can occasionally also get a Makeover.\nThe Adrenaline Makeover has Unfortunate Implications, as it can be viewed as a contradiction of the Be Yourself trope. This trope can also be viewed as implying that a woman is not desirable just as she was; she was not worth noticing or the hero's interest until her adventure-triggered transformation took her from plain to pretty.\nBasically Fan Service Pack as Character Development.

Want to stress how depraved and vicious your killer is? Have him\u2014it's almost always a man\u2014target and/or kill a few sex workers\u2014and they are nearly always women\u2014to drive home the fact. Maybe it's because walking the streets is a dangerous occupation and the ladies involved tend to make easier targets for weirdos. Maybe it's because sex workers are an Acceptable Target. Maybe the prostitutes are killed because they know something they shouldn't, or a villain thinks they do. Or maybe it's just easy short-hand to let people know there's a Serial Killer loose out there, but the sex industry tends to have a high percentage of casualties when it comes to this kind of thing. And they will nearly always be forgotten by the story eventually.\nThis is, in some ways, a Truth in Television. Prostitution (especially of the street-walking variety) carries with it a certain amount of danger by its nature, as the ladies occupy a gray area in society outside of the law, often being ignored both by the law and society at large as a result, and must by necessity place their trust in strangers whose intentions may not be benign. Simple practicality on the killer's part is often a factor: prostitutes do, after all, make their living by accompanying clients to places of the johns' choosing, without drawing witnesses' or authorities' attention to their rendezvous. In all too many cases, women in the sex industry may be a Real Life Serial Killer's first/only victims.note Indeed, it's not uncommon for the Serial Killer to specifically target prostitutes, and actually believe that he's doing society a favor by killing them.\nIn many cases regarding their depiction, however, there is an unfortunate sense that the ladies in question are being somewhat... dehumanized in the process. The unfortunate ladies who fall victim to the killer are rarely given any kind of character outside of their profession. If they are lucky, we'll learn their name(s), and if the producers really want to hammer it home how far they're fallen we'll probably get some sense of their home life (which will no doubt contain some kind of drug-addiction, abuse, or even a child raised in poverty). They will usually be a vaguely formed Hooker with a Heart of Gold at best, someone with a conveniently tragic reason to be targeted by a serial killer.\nSometimes we don't even get that; we just get a string of nameless dead hookers. There can also be a sense that these women have it coming or somehow deserve what happens to them because of their circumstances; the detectives involved may be dismissive or or even contemptuous towards the victims and the other women in the same position because of their profession. This can be especially glaring if the killer then targets a woman who is not a prostitute. Whereas the victims from the sex industry may be casually dismissed as victims who \"had it coming,\" the non-sex worker victim will be treated as an innocent whose death is a tragedy and must be avenged. Similarly, if a dead woman is mistaken for a sex worker, then her death might be initially dismissed, only for everyone to pick up and work their damned hardest to solve the case once it's revealed that she's actually an 'innocent'.\nThe Disposable Sex Worker has an odd mixed relationship with Missing White Woman Syndrome. On one hand, they're mutually exclusive due to sex-worker victims not being \"wholesome\" ladies (especially if they're minorities compared to a white \"normal\" victim). But on the other hand, male and transgender female sex workers are almost never given mention in fiction or real life, despite being just as likely or even moreso to be victims of violent crime, but with authorities even less likely to care.\nCompare to Disposable Vagrant.

It's an extremely formal phrase, and probably is most commonly heard in period dramas.\nIn modern times, it has three main uses:\n An idol-follower relationship between young women, usually signifying extreme adoration on the part of the follower.\n A subset of the first type of relationship, signalling a lesbian relationship with the uke referring to the seme as \"Onee-sama\". I.e., the Onee-Seme.\n Identification of a very formal and traditional relationship between sisters. Most likely to be used by very traditional families, (miko, samurai, Yamato Nadeshiko, etc.). Tends to be a sign of awe rather than affection. (Awe can mean either adoration, or a type of fear).\nThe Onee-sama is always an older character, if only by a year. She's essentially a princess for the other characters with grace, beauty, and poise. The Onee-sama often overlaps with Aloof Dark-Haired Girl, but usually comes in two flavors.\nOne kind is reflexively affectionate and doting, finding frequent excuses for giving hugs; the kohai is treated like a puppy, although the Onee-sama might be a Dorm Mother.\nThe other is the 'serious' one, a girl who seems cold but enticingly mysterious; almost always the \"alpha\" schoolgirl. As sign that they view themselves as an idol to the rest of their coterie, the Ojou may demand to be referred to this way. When part of a romance she is likely to act possessively towards her object of affection to disguise her romantic feelings.\nMainly appropriated by the yuri fandom, it has become so closely identified with a particular brand of the Sempai Kohai relationship that it is very difficult to use without carrying the connotations of attraction. Ironically, the increasingly overt behavior of Onee-sama can probably also be attributed to shounen's use of this phrase.\nSometimes the term is rejected by its target, because she doesn't want to be the object of adoration and perfection that the term implies. If the romance element is present, a rejection of the term signals that she's straight and so does not return the affections of the girl referring to her as \"Onee-sama\".\nNot to be confused with Oba San.\nContrast with Cool Big Sis, who is less lady-like and more flirty. Often unapologetically so. Due to Values Dissonance, that is where non-Japanese media examples should go as well." }

In Japanese works especially, naginatas are a common weapon for a female close-range fighter. In works that don't stress the relatively subtle difference between weapons, it may be generalized to simply \"spear\" rather than a naginata.\nIn practical terms, a pole weapon makes sense for a woman as its longer reach compensates for the woman's presumed shorter stature. Additionally it is effective since weight and strength are less important at a distance.\nThis has its roots in Japanese history. After the naginatas fell out of use by soldiers and samurai on the battlefield, they found a place as a symbol of status for samurai's wives. While advancements in firearms led to the weapon not being as useful on the battlefield, a noblewoman was still expected to be able to defend her home with it while her husband was at war. Even up to this day it's a common after school activity in Japan, even though now young girls practice kendo and archery more often, specially compared to before.\nOftentimes the naginata-user is contrasted by a man (or boyish girl) who uses a more traditional weapon, highlighting the femininity inherent in this trope.\nOften a sign of a Lady of War and a Yamato Nadeshiko.

Some states \u2014 California is one \u2014 have made sex with anyone under 18 a crime as well.  This was done not because they wanted to protect boys from abuse so much as preventing someone from mounting a legal challenge over a law that criminalizes having sex with an underage girl but not with an underage boy.\nThere's also been some recognition over the years by some state legislators that it doesn't make much sense to send some boy to prison for several years because his girlfriend, who might be a year or two younger than him, is underage and if she wasn't nobody would have said anything.  So some states have set up what are called \"Romeo and Juliet\" laws, where if the age difference is within three or four years, it's either not a crime or reduced from a serious felony to a misdemeanor.\nBut it still provides some interesting incidents." }

This is an able-bodied woman with some established ability who is just standing around on the sidelines, helplessly watching while the men do all the dirty work.\nSo no trying to improvise to assist the hero.

You could replace her with an inanimate prop for all the good she's doing.\nThe situation doesn't necessarily have to be Hero vs Villain. It can also apply between good guys, especially in terms of romantic competition. The point is that the girl is still not helping either of them nor doing anything to stop the fight, not even by saying something that could settle everything between the combatants.\nThere are cases where this can be justified. As stated above, she may be injured or Bound and Gagged and thus unable to move. She could be lower on the Super Weight scale or lack experience. Another reason could be This Is Something He's Got to Do Himself (where none of the hero's allies help him) or the hero insists on an honorable one-on-one duel.\nWhat differentiates her from a regular Load is that it's established she has abilities or has choices at her disposal but when confronted with duking it out among the boys she's suddenly rendered inept by virtue of being female. Compare to Damsel in Distress but with a case of Faux Action Girl; which often serves as both the source and result of this trope.

However, sometimes this may be explained as being a test for determining whether or not to lift this barring. Other times, circumstances may force female troops not serving in combat positions to take this role because modern war contains no real front lines.\nIf the Squadette is particularly skilled, she's also an Action Girl.

Basically, she will either go around acting like a Drama Queen and wangsting up over every minor little thing (\"My life is over!\") or else she'll just roll her eyes exasperatedly at the \"wacky\" hijinks the rest of the family gets up to, often becoming a bit of a sullen killjoy in the process.\nHer most valued personal possession is the phone. She talks (or texts) endlessly on it with her friends, and breaks down when she's without it. In older media, this will lead to a confrontation with Mom where she tells her to stop tying up the phone lines. Today, these confrontations are likely to revolve around cellphone bills, or the loss of phone privileges as a punishment.\nThe natural enemies of the Bratty Teenage Daughter are assorted Annoying Younger Siblings and anything else that upsets the status quo of her little world as she sits in her room listening on her headphones to the latest music from that hot pop star she has a huge crush on. She will be more averse to the Horrible Camping Trip than any other member of the family, and she will inevitably act as a City Mouse on such a trip, continuously complaining about breaking her nails or how much she would rather be at the mall.\nShe tends to be a supporting character, with the show's focus usually only being put on her in the event of a Very Special Episode about drugs, underaged sex, etc. Often (but by no means always) an Alpha Bitch or The Brainless Beauty. If she's not, expect her to hide it carefully since smart people are never cool at that age. Is usually one of the sisters caught up in The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry. She can easily become The Scrappy if she's whiny and grating enough.\nIf the teenage daughter is the show's protagonist, she probably won't be this character, or at least, not as extreme a version. May sometimes have a brother in the Dumbass Teenage Son." }

If the character is lucky, that mother will be a loving one, and if he or she is really lucky, she'll be an Action Mom who can kick ass and take names if the character is ever threatened.\nBut if the character is really unlucky and isn't suffering from Parental Abandonment, the character's mother will be an Evil Matriarch and chances are, she will make that character's life a living hell.\nThe Evil Matriarch comes in two forms:\nComedic: Usually used in the Dom Com, this variety is usually the mother of one of the two parents on the show who comes to visit every so often, and someone on the cast dreads it. Usually (though not always) this variety of Evil Matriarch is a meddling parent, often to an irrational extreme. Classically, this is a Mother-in-Law situation, but from time to time, the kids themselves, or even the child of the mother is the one that dreads it. In some cases, everyone hates the Evil Matriarch, like in Malcolm in the Middle where everyone dreads Lois's mother coming to visit. In other cases, her visit is appreciated by everyone but the daughter or son of the Evil Matriarch, like in Family Ties, where the matriarch is evil because her daughter feels she can't live up to mom's perfection. Expect this variety of Evil Matriarch to have Power Hair and other Fashionable Evil.\nDramatic: This variety, which shows up in more dramatic media, is truly evil in a traditional sense, and is one of the worst villains one can face, especially if one of the Heroes or Love Interests is one of her children (or if she's married into his or her family as a stepmother). Many such Evil Matriarchs are completely convinced that they, and only they, know what's best for their children, and can be very controlling, manipulative, and perfectly willing to do anything they deem necessary for their children's sake, no matter how evil or destructive it may be. The most vicious examples of this variety of Evil Matriarch despise their children (or at least the one they've singled out as The Unfavorite) and are often physically or emotionally abusive towards them, and many of them are not above Offing the Offspring.\nIf she's not entirely human, then expect her to be a Hive Queen. If she is also the Queen, expect its time for God Save Us from the Queen!.\nThe Spear Counterpart of this character type is Archnemesis Dad. The inversion is Antagonistic Offspring. See Abusive Parents and Parental Neglect for the more mundane versions. See Offing the Offspring and/or Self-Made Orphan for what this might lead to if the kids fight back.

The exception is if the The Dragon or the Big Bad are a different gender and deign to fight the heroes. And much like Monster Misogyny applied in reverse, guy heroes will only fight guy monsters, and girl heroines will only fight girl monsters. Though girl heroes fighting male monsters is not uncommon either, male is kinda of the default gender for Mooks (if not the default gender in fiction).\nThis also tends to follow the predominant gender among the cast. Mostly girl heroines? Then it's female monsters. Mostly guy heroes? Then it's male monsters.\nThere's really two reasons this happens:\n It's a lot easier on the costume/animation department if everything is fairly uniform across the board for the generic cannon fodder and slightly less generic Monster of the Week. There's also an easy story justification when monsters are involved: simply put, they are all modified forms of one design, pressed from a single mold, created by the same spell or, in the case of the first generation of Imperial Storm Troopers, cloned from the same guy.\n In the case of where the single gender protagonist(s) fight single gender monsters, this is probably to avoid Unfortunate Implications. Violence of men against men and women against women isn't viewed with the same sort of sensitivity as men against women.

She is far more likely to have Rapunzel Hair than Wild Hair, and her legs and armpits will be inexplicably hairless.\nFor some unfathomable reason, the animals of the jungle obey her slavishly instead of viewing her as lunch, and the woefully benighted Hollywood Natives treat her as a goddess. If the Jungle Princess is particularly naive, she'll buy into that belief. Even if she's not particularly naive and although she may well possess some fearsomely strong instincts and drives toward it, her isolation from humans has left her with no concept whatsoever of romance.\nInevitably, she will encounter a hunky European explorer (rather than a - perish the thought - relationship with a native) usually by rescuing him from some local danger, and they will fall in love.

She might not even speak the same language as the main characters' during her initial introduction to further highlight her cryptic nature. She can be selfless to the point of self-sacrifice at times.\nSure signs you're dealing with a Mystical Waif are odd hair colors; weird (by the standards of the game world), often futuristic-themed clothing; magical powers; blank, serious facial expressions; lots of ellipses in her speech; and an inordinate amount of attention from the villains.

Her beauty is an important point here, underlining her fragility and the sadness of her fate. She usually talks in riddles and rhymes, can be sad or joyfully happy (or switch between these states). Her mind may be so far gone that she's likely to murder people, but she'll always have clear skin while doing it. Sometimes, too, she has important knowledge the sane may lack, in which case she'll often have terrible trouble getting anyone to listen (a classical example of Mad Oracle). The original Cassandra from The Iliad was often depicted as a bit of an Ophelia.\nIt's difficult to pin down the appeal of this trope. Perhaps a strange young maiden communing with nature harkens back to earlier figures like nymphs or pagan witches. Perhaps there is an underlying Fetish Fuel at the thought that a crazy girl might be crazy amazing in the sack. Or perhaps there's something endearing to men about cradling a girl in your arms and protecting her from the demons in her own head.\nThere's often a surprisingly artistic bent to The Ophelia's madness; she may sing, dance wildly, or try to paint her delusions. She is often tied to nature (including walking around barefoot, wearing flowers, etc.), particularly water, probably as a nod to the original Ophelia (in William Shakespeare's Hamlet) who winds flowers in her hair before drowning herself. That last bit can overlap with Instant Oracle, Just Add Water if she's also a Waif Prophet and/or a Mad Oracle.\nThe Victorians fell crazy (so to speak) in love with this trope and Ophelias in the form of wronged maidens and deranged brides go pirouetting and flower-strewing through art, poetry and literature of the period while the \"mad scene\" for the soprano heroine became a staple of opera. Insanity was linked to female sexuality and desire for independence. (Not coincidentally, the vibrator was invented in this same period as a treatment for hysteria in women.) In fact, psychiatrists at that time used to encourage female patients in madhouses \u2014 especially if they were youthful and pretty \u2014 to dress the part and carry sheaves of flowers.\nIf a male character is shown the same way, odds are good he's very feminine and delicate-looking anyway.\nCompare/contrast with Nightmare Fuel Station Attendant, Cloudcuckoolander, Fainting Seer, Axe Crazy, Mysterious Waif, Waif Prophet, Hysterical Woman.

The trope name comes from the Greek word hysteros, womb or uterus. As a result female characters may be coddled, or their opinions undervalued. In Western works it's more likely to affect female characters over the age of 30 and who are Hollywood Homely and/or Hollywood Pudgy; bonus points if she's a Housewife.\nA blatant Double Standard, it was used and invoked quite freely in older works. These days it is rarely invoked, as most people are aware of the obvious Unfortunate Implications. Despite that it's still more common to portray female characters becoming emotionally overwrought when under stress or behaving more irrationally than men, even when it would be out-of-character. Male characters like this are likely to be unsympathetic or comedic. An insensitive male character may ask, \"Are you on your period?\" or something on those lines.\nCompare The Ophelia which is about genuine insanity. Often prone to Inelegant Blubbering.

The character in question tends to follow a certain set of characteristics. The most obvious one is being (almost) Always Female. Especially in older works she'll also almost certainly be a virgin, remain fully clothed, avoid Death by Sex , and probably won't drink alcohol, smoke tobacco or take drugs, either. Finally, she'll probably turn out to be more intelligent and resourceful than the other victims, occasionally even evolving into a type of Action Girl by the movie's end. Looking at the Sorting Algorithm of Mortality, you could say that the Final Girl is a combination of The Hero, The Cutie and the Damsel in Distress - which obviously gives her a very low deadness score. The Final Girl is usually but not always brunette, often in contrast to a promiscuous blonde who traditionally gets killed off.\nIt's also interesting to note how the Final Girl can be interpreted in film theory. On one hand, the character seems to be the living embodiment of stereotypical conservative attitudes of what women \"should be\". On the other, feminists have noticed that through this device, a predominantly male audience is forced to identify with a woman in the climax of the movie. In practical terms, the makers of a horror film want the victim to experience abject terror in the climax, and feel that viewers would reject a film that showed a man experiencing such abject terror.\nThe term was coined by Carol J. Clover in her critical examination of slasher movies.\nIf the Final Girl appears in a sequel to the movie she survived, there is a very high chance that she will fall victim to Sudden Sequel Death Syndrome.\nThis trope has seen a growing number of subversions, aversions and parodies in recent years which suggests it may be slowly weakening. Then again, the Action Survivor's replacing the Action Hero points in an interesting direction.\nThank God for Lowered Monster Difficulty.\nUsually overlaps with Token Wholesome.

This could be because she herself is melancholy, or because the lonely male hero experiences a connection with her while she is singing but cannot have her. She tends to be out of the main hero's reach perhaps because she is a dangerous Femme Fatale, because she is already involved with someone else (usually a villain), or simply because she is so aloof. This character can be very useful for highlighting a feeling of loneliness, because her sultry songs will often create a feeling of a connection between the singer and the listener, but circumstances will prevent that feeling from becoming a true connection.

She will encourage them to be themselves and talk about The Power of Love. Eventually this message will spread to the parents, drawing the family together. This type of Magical Nanny is often musically talented.\nA sensible nanny will usually work for aloof or ineffectual parents with rambunctious children. She will be strict, but fair and impose a sense of structure on a family that badly needs it. Before long, the parents will be in awe of her \u2014 perhaps after a stage of resenting how their lavishness did not win the children's hearts but her firmness (and attention!) did \u2014 and any naughty children will have learned that behaving themselves can be fun.\nA sub-flavor includes magical nannies that are literally Magical Nannies. Often they will be a parody or even Deconstruction of the Ur Example, Mary Poppins.\nWhile Magical Nannies are often threatened with the sack, they are not easy to get rid of. When their employment ends, it will be on their own terms. Typically they will decide that their work here is done or they will stay and marry the head of the household.

She will also quite often have some sort of spoilt and pampered (and very often overweight) child or pet, a Persian or a Pomeranian or a parrot, on whom the rest of her dependents must dance attendance. In most cases, any attempt at frivolity will draw from her either a frigid stare of disapproval or sheer, blank incomprehension. Nevertheless, she will occasionally turn out to be a sympathetic character as well \u2014 very occasionally she will turn out to have a screwball or eccentric streak herself.\nAs she sinks down toward the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, she will on uncommon occasions become a Deadpan Snarker, though if she goes too far, she may turn into the Rich Bitch; as she rises toward the idealistic end, she may become the more friendly Maiden Aunt \u2014 in very rare cases (like Ellen O'Hara) she may become the saintly \"great lady\". Both extremes are uncommon, however, as in general she preserves the status quo as a Moral Guardian \u2014 she may well have started out as an Apron Matron \u2014 and her watchword is \"Respectability.\" If she loses this and begins to hit the bottle, there is a good chance she will turn into Lady Drunk.\nThe trope is nearly always a Comedy Trope, associated particularly with the Comedy of Manners; as such, it serves as a useful device for mocking social pretensions, and dates back to the ancient Roman plays of Plautus and Terence, where the Grande Dame appeared as the Matrona. She was not used much in the uninhibited Middle Ages, but made a comeback as the humorless, self-important dueña of the 16th and 17th century Spanish theater (Small Name, Big Ego Doña Rodríguez is the only one character stupid enough in all the novel to believe that Don Quixote is a real Knight Errant) . The prude and bluestocking of the Restoration (such as Molière's Arsinoé and his Précieuses ridicules) and Sentimental comedies (for instance, Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's The Rivals) have some affinities with the type, insofar as they made pretensions to virtue and culture, but it was only with the Victorian age that the great era of the Grande Dame opened. Here, with her fur stole and her ancestral lorgnette in hand, the Grande Dame quashed social climbers, sought advantageous marriages for her daughters and repelled impossible matches for her sons, and maintained the natural order of Society with frigid hauteur for a good hundred years and more. In England, she was generally in Debrett and was called \"Lady\" something if she didn't have some title or other (\"Countess\" was particularly imposing); in the US, she was one of the Brahmins or the Four Hundred or the FFV and was called \"Mrs. Van\" Whoozis or Miss Firstname. She will still turn up occasionally, to preside over banquets and to be aghast at the excesses of Feminism or the Youth movement and to wonder why no young ladies bother to go to the cotillion any more.\nHer plot function will usually be as an obstruction to the plans of the protagonist, though she will occasionally convert to his side \u2014 more rarely, she may assist from the first.\nGrandes Dames do not have to be useless, of course. A Grande Dame can be a noblewoman or tribal elder and act as a Seer, an Iron Lady, or The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask stoutly and cunningly defending her domain.

This is an example of Artistic License - History in the name of Fanservice: even leaving aside the fact that the costume is a Western invention, it would logically only be worn by belly dancers and perhaps harem girls.

The old westerns and pulp fiction usually depicted them as raven-haired, olive-skinned, and red-clad, with an accent that can melt butter. Modern portrayals, however, are usually more urban.\nThis character is very Hot-Blooded and confrontational, and often times has a rough background where they had to learn to defend themselves. They usually display an almost Tsundere-ish quality of having a soft side that occasionally peeks out from their tough exterior. Expect the Spicy Latina to be a good fighter who can take care of herself, which ironically can lead to her becoming the designated early casualty. There's also a crossover with Mama Bear in some cases. The Spicy Latina can make for a great Femme Fatale for The Hero. Even if the Spicy Latina is a bit tomboyish, she will be irresistible. If not tomboyish, she's usually wearing a lot of sexy tight clothing and she would happen to be very flirty. Despite this, she is often a devout Catholic.\nWhen they aren't masculine, a Spicy Latina will usually be a great beauty and highly sought after, as well as being an accomplished fighter. For a male hero, having her as a Love Interest is therefore an indication of unusual prestige, self actualisation, and both pyschological and physical strength, since he will need to be able to restrain her fiery nature and martial ability at times, without destroying the relationship.\nActresses likely to play this role include:\n Maria Conchita Alonso\n Michelle Rodriguez (pictured)\n Jennifer Lopez\n Rosie Perez, even when she's animated\n Penélope Cruz\n Salma Hayek\n Sofia Vergara\n Catherine Zeta Jones (even though the actress herself is not actually Hispanic)\n Dania Ramirez\n Zoe Saldana, on occasion, though she's more likely to portray the Sassy Black Woman\nClose cousin to the Sassy Black Woman, but generally more erotic (the two tropes can overlap if the character is mixed). Also see Latin Lover \u2014 and speaking of which, the same rule about particular non-Latin ethnicities still counting also applies here. Its Old World analog is the Hot Gypsy Woman. Overall, an enduring character-type, even if the characters themselves are not.\nImportant Note: just because a Latina character is attractive does not neccessarily make her fiery or spicy. A Latina played as a down to earth Girl Next Door or a bubbly Brainless Beauty is not an example of this trope because such a character lacks the attitude and personality of the Spicy Latina.

In Real Life, though, many a Soiled Dove ended up marrying and leaving what was then called the Sporting Life. This was especially true in The Wild West, where women were at a premium. Some ended up becoming a Determined Homesteader's Wife. Their former lives were generally not held against them, and the act of marriage bestowed social respectability on them.\nFiction provided another solution, though. The Miss Kitty is a Soiled Dove turned entrepreneur. She is the proprietor of the local drinking establishment, very often a Fish out of Water. Sometimes, she has obtained her establishment through the circumstances of becoming a Determined Widow. She is always of a certain age. She is tough as nails. She has an unlimited supply of something that passes for whiskey, with sasparilla for the Determined Homesteader's Children. She has no tolerance for \"rowdiness\" in her establishment and very often has a shotgun handy to make certain that her policy is enforced. She goes out of her way to make certain that no one mistreats her \"girls\". She acts as mother-confessor for anyone in town and always has time to provide people with advice and common-sense wisdom. Occasionally, Preacher Man berates her for operating a Den of Iniquity, but most of the time he accepts her business as a necessary evil. She is almost always on the side of the angels.\nInitially, Bowdlerization restricted her activities to running a saloon. In today's media, most establishments run by a Miss Kitty are more obviously brothels with ancillary booze service.\nIf the two are close in age, she will be the love interest of The Sheriff or the U.S. Marshal. She is the employer of the Dance Hall Girl and The Piano Player. The Bartender is always her trusted subordinate, if she employs one.\nThe Miss Kitty is restricted in time and setting. She will be almost exclusively found either in the United States or Canada. In the US, she'll be found between 1860 (the start of the American Civil War) and 1911 (the year the Everleigh Club in Chicago was closed). In Canada she'll usually be in shows set in Alberta or the North (especially the Klondike), and can show up at a much later date than in the US \u2014 as late as the mid-1950s for shows set in the Territories. She can also be found in Speculative Fiction that uses a setting that is analogous. The Wild West is her natural habitat, but she can often be found in urban red-light districts of the period. The Miss Kitty does not necessarily have to be female, although the nurturing aspects of a Miss Kitty are more of a female trait.\nThe trope was so pervasive in Western Canada in the post-World War I era that the phrasing \"Miss Firstname\" was (and to some extent, still is) used only to refer to madams and whores. This naturally surprises visitors from the southern US, for whom this phrasing is a respectable way for children to refer to adult women. Hilarity can ensue.\nThe Trope Namer is Miss Kitty, the proprietor of the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City in Gunsmoke.

A grandmotherly type may be a lot better at prying relevant but embarrassing details from suspects than the gruff policeman. Finally, she is frequently protected by Even Evil Has Standards: who would dare to off the nice old lady? Not that the perp thinks she's nice...\nMore realistic takes on the concept have her solving minor misdemeanors and crimes which the police are too busy to solve.

So there would be a one-room schoolhouse, with a grand total of one teacher (usually female) presiding over a class of children of all ages and scholastic ability.\nGenerally, a child would attend the one-room schoolhouse from early elementary age through the minimum dropout age required by law; those seeking further education would have to go to a larger community's boarding school.\nIn fiction, a schoolmarm will tend to be portrayed as rather prim and proper, and will have the best diction in town. This tended to be true in Real Life as well, since most communities had strict moral and behavioral requirements in the contracts for their teachers. In many school districts, teachers had to be single and any \"courtship\" would raise fears that the town would lose its schoolmarm. Nevertheless, the Schoolmarm is a frequent choice for female love interest in a Western as she'll be the only single woman around who isn't in the entertainment industry.\nIn male viewer-oriented stories, the schoolmarm tends to be young and pretty\u2014sometimes suspiciously so. In stories from the schoolmarm's point of view, she may be a bit older and somewhat plain-looking, to make her eventual romantic involvement that much sweeter. If the story is from the children's point of view, the schoolmarm will often be a hatchet-faced spinster, who's not afraid of using a switch on misbehaving youths, for loose values of \"misbehaving.\"\nSince schoolteachers were usually from out of town, they would often board with the different families of their students in turn over the course of the school year. In fiction, this might be an awkward situation, the beginning of a romance with an adult member of the family, the discovery of a Big Sister Mentor for a younger member, or otherwise played for drama.\nThe Distaff Counterpart was a \"schoolmaster.\" See also Two Teacher School." }

Oh, she can dance a country dance or pour tea with the best of them, but she may also be a good walker or horseback rider. She may be the most intelligent girl in the story, and she's almost certainly the wittiest and the most outspoken, sometimes earning her the title of spitfire. She may be talented in more practical ways, as well: if given the opportunity, she may turn out to be a wise investor, and she may harbor talent for music, writing or art that goes beyond drawing room entertainment and might become a means of financial independence if necessary. In rare cases, she may even solve a murder. Though she occasionally runs into some trouble, especially if she fails to obey the powers that be, she usually comes through in the end. She will be the Veronica of a Betty and Veronica love triangle, and the hero is likely to find her more enticing than her more docile sisters.\nThe Spirited Young Lady has the same grace and style as the Proper Lady plus an added spark of attitude or rebellion that's missing from her more-prim-and-proper literary cousin. This is what makes her such a popular character today: she's the character modern audiences can most admire or relate to. In historical fiction, she's likely to be a proto-feminist. In nineteenth-century literature, she may not speak out for women's rights generally (a few examples do), but she will speak out for her rights pretty clearly. Her willingness to say what she wants is part of what makes her stand out.

She may literally be from the same neighborhood as the hero, or she may just remind him of girls he knew back home. She embodies an average and \"wholesome\" femininity. She is neither butch nor overly feminine; she isn't usually promiscuous, and she might act as a foil to a woman who is, such as the \"downtown girl\" in Town Girls grouping. She is typically pretty in an accessible way. However, since the trope is essentially about her personality, some Girls Next Door are considered knock-outs. In that case, though, they're probably the local beauty in a neighborhood or small town, rather then being famous for their looks in a wider context \u2014 to start with, anyway, though they may advance to fame or stardom in the course of the story.\nAs the kind of girl that male protagonist might have been friends with all his life, the Girl Next Door is easy to talk to, like a tomboy, but she doesn't force her presence on anybody; she may keep to herself, like a Naïve Everygirl, while not rejecting social interaction. Equally, she may well be a bad boy's fantasy or target, because he finds her \"good girl\" image a challenge. She has the goodness of the light feminine in Light Feminine and Dark Feminine; she is good and attractive but not vain or arrogant about it. She certainly doesn't give the impression that she's spicy or fiery \u2014 at least not obviously so, though she may have hidden depths of some sort. Nothing says that she has to be incapable of passion; she's just unlikely to be extrovert about it.\nOften when a Girl Next Door is involved, the story has one of three types of plot: she's the Unlucky Childhood Friend to the male lead (usually a jock); she has a male Unlucky Childhood Friend that is chasing after her; or she is the Betty in a Betty and Veronica Love Triangle. Occasionally, all three combine in a huge mess. (This set-up was used, more or less, in several movies by John Hughes.) Possibly she is with the main character as a childhood, college, or high school sweetheart, but this isn't always the case.\nThe Spear Counterpart, Boy Next Door, is pretty much the same only, you know, male. Compare Tomboy and contrast with Femme Fatale and Peerless Love Interest. Also compare The All-American Boy, who might well be her High School Sweetheart.\nFor the 2004 film, see The Girl Next Door.

She'll often have self-serving reasons for pushing her kids into showbiz (as demonstrated by the above quote), using them to vicariously experience the fame and fortune that she had dreamed of, and possibly being a failed actress or musician herself. In this case, the trope overlaps with Coattail-Riding Relative. The kid will often turn out to be the worst kind of Former Child Star if she isn't brought into check.\nStage Mom's may also take on a late role, suddenly interfering with a long lost son or daughter's off-screen fame and manipulate said famous kin's exploitable trait (such as being kind and/or aloof to the Stage Mom and his/her agenda), which will near enough always turn on it's head at some point in the story (as good will always triumph over evil etc.) and the Stage Mom will realise what a bad parent they have been, which may or may not be followed by the child doing something to wrap up the plot so that writers don't have to worry about that plot point anymore, such as disowning them, or that they aren't mentioned afterwards. Late Stage Moms are often the result of loose ends involving the Parent and Child.\nThis is almost Always Female for cultural reasons. A man is expected to earn stuff on their own, and if he and his wife are both pushy stage parents the wife is usually the one on the scene to take the blame (see Shirley Temple). If a dad is the pushy parent, it's more likely to be in sports rather than showbiz, as becoming an athlete is a more socially-acceptable boyhood dream than singing (with the exception of maybe becoming a rock star), dancing, or acting due to the stereotype that such aspirations are effeminate for boys. The \"living their childhood dreams through their kids\" aspect will often be out in full force in this case.\nNot wanting to deal with stage moms is one of the many reasons why Dawson Casting exists." }

The one thing this sexy vampiress doesn't have is a lust for hot male blood. No, only the blood of an innocent young woman will do. And lucky for her, the nightclubs are full of easily swayed bi-curious beauties.\nHowever, she'd better be careful to make sure that her next victim doesn't have a handsome young boyfriend or older guardian ready to leap in and save the day, or she might end up in an urn...\nThe lesbian vampire is an old trope, stretching back to the 19th century novella Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu, which heavily inspired Bram Stoker's rather more famous Dracula. However, it didn't return into popular consciousness until the 1970s, when Hammer Horror made numerous films in which voluptuous countesses nibbled nubile young women. Since then, the trope has pretty much become the default setting for most female vampires, adding an extra layer of titillation to an already heavily sexualised mythological creature.\nThis blatant sexualisation sometimes leads to a variation \u2014 the Bisexual Vampire (often of the Depraved Bisexual sort). In this case, the sexy vampire will happily take both men and women to bed, but her primary target for the duration of the story will usually be female.\nA variation on the lesbian vampire, particularly in pornography and films aimed at the young male demographic, is the female victim who is seduced and converted by a male vampire and \u2014 either during the process of her seduction or after being transformed \u2014 begins to find women sexually attractive. This is sometimes explained as the vampire warping her mind so that she can become one of his harem, but usually, it is assumed that as soon as a woman joins the ranks of the undead, she immediately starts playing for both teams \u2014 such is the power of this trope.\nThis can lead to some controversial sexual politics; while the idea that lesbianism or bisexuality is the result of a corruptive and malign influence, representative of moral decay, was standard back in the olden days, today, it tends to be challenged. And if a female victim is transformed by a female vampire, it carries the implication that homosexuals are predatory and waiting to ensnare and 'convert' hapless heterosexuals.\nOn the other hand, this neatly provides a convenient fantasy outlet. If you're going to be seduced by sexy minions of the night, no one will blame you for enjoying it, right?\nAnd, in yet another interpretation of modern media, lesbianism sometimes seems to come as part of taking a level in badass for young women. After all, if you become a vampire, you're no longer bound to puritanical notions of sexuality that are often a part of human life. Why not reexamine your sexual identity if you have some long-buried tendencies waiting to burst out?\nIn the works of some authors, such as Anne Rice, the Gender Flip version of this trope (i.e., male vampires attracted to other males) does exist; typically, they (like standard-issue female 'lesbian' vampires) are bisexual rather than exclusively same-sex attracted.\nIf one were to use Fridge Logic, vampires don't reproduce through sex (except for when they do), and most half-vampyrs are usually bad news for them. So gender preference is just cosmetic anyway.\nLesbian Vampire is a Sub-Trope of Discount Lesbians and often of Depraved Homosexual. See also Horny Devils and Hemo Erotic.\n\nExamples" }

A gentile partner might also be a status symbol in areas where Jews are still discriminated against. Other Jewish men might simply be more attracted to women without Semitic features. Shiksas are often blonde and blue-eyed, traits more rare among Jews, to distinguish them from the Jewish norm.\nThe word \"shiksa\" comes from the Hebrew word for \"abomination,\" as these gentile temptresses were feared to be stealing away all the Nice Jewish Boys.

An active sex life makes one a Whore... unless one is married, and sometimes not even then. The Madonna-Whore complex is a notable contrast to the The Three Faces of Eve as it ignores the Wife archetype (one who is sexually active but morally good/\"pure\") and creates a False Dichotomy between the Child and Seductress categories of females. That said, many Madonnas are wives, though they are more often mothers or sisters, or other females with close emotional ties to whomever considers them a Madonna.\nThe Madonna-Whore Complex (aka \"Virgin-Whore Complex\") was described by Sigmund Freud on the basis of some of his clinical work. Specifically, he noticed the difficulty some men had in having sexual relations with their wives because they differentiated women into these categories. Those men were aroused by prostitutes and mistresses but not their wives because, paradoxically, they respected the latter too much (they viewed them as fellow humans, i.e. not whores) to be sexually attracted to them.\nOccasionally this is enforced by The Scourge of God.\nCompare Slut Shaming, Light Feminine and Dark Feminine, Betty and Veronica, My Girl Is Not a Slut, Sensible Heroes, Skimpy Villains, Good People Have Good Sex.

The term, \"Jewish American Princess\" is often abbreviated to the acronym \"JAP.\"\nThe Jewish American princess stereotype was a construct of and popularized by post-war Jewish male writers. Notable works that popularized this stereotype are Herman Wouk's 1955 novel, Marjorie Morningstar and Philip Roth's 1959 novel Goodbye, Columbus.\nThe acronym, \"JAP\" and the associated stereotype gained attention in the 1970s with the publication of several non-fiction articles. Barbara Meyer's Cosmopolitan article \"Sex and the Jewish Girl\" and the 1971 cover article in New York Magazine by Julie Baumgold, \"The Persistence of the Jewish Princess\" are two such notable articles. The Jewish American Princess stereotype's rise to prominence in the 1970s resulted from pressures on the Jewish middle class to maintain a visibly affluent lifestyle as post-war affluence declined.\nThe stereotype is portrayed as over-indulged by her parents with attention and money. This results in the princess having both unrealistic expectations and guilt and skill in the manipulation of guilt in others, which results in a deficient love life. The stereotype is also portrayed as sexually-repressive, overly-concerned with appearance, and indifferent to sex, the latter her most notable trait.\nValley Girl is a Sister Trope. Some of these girls can fall under Spoiled Brat or Idle Rich." }

Oh, and Girlish Pigtails aren't unheard of among them.\nFarmer's Daughters are usually kept at home under very strict rules and supposedly know very little about the \"ways of the world\" - or at least ''pretend'' they don't - and therefore tend to be overly curious about sex. Watch out, though; their pops will have a shotgun and will use it if you try anything funny with them, like for instance Roll in the Hay with them. And if she's knocked up? Shotgun Wedding time!

The three aspects of a triune goddess or trinity of goddesses appear as sisters. They are the maiden (often blonde and beautiful, and either a naive ditz or a budding seductress), the matron/mother (often plump and rather eccentric, or pregnant, as the page image shows) and the crone (often sharp-witted, sharp-tongued, bitter and unsentimental). In terms of a Freudian Trio, the maiden is the Id, the crone is the Superego, and the mother is the Ego. Even though they are the same being, they seem to know and think different things, so they bicker. In fantasy stories, these characters may be exactly what they appear, or they may be a trio of witches or wise women who reflect the aspects of the goddess.\nThis trope has the unusual distinction of being either Older Than Feudalism, or Newer Than They Think: Most of what we know about triple-goddess mythology comes from the author and mythologist Robert Graves, who, like many of his early 20th-century contemporaries, tended to add his own ideas wherever he felt they were needed.\nIn Greek mythology and religion, the three Moirae presided over the birth, destiny, and death of all human beings: Clotho (the Maiden) spins a person's life thread, Lachesis (the Mother) measures the thread, and finally, Atropos (the Crone) cuts the thread, thus ending the person's life.\nThe maiden is like the sexy one, the mother like the admirable one, and the crone like the mannish one of the Four Girl Ensemble.\nCompared to The Three Faces of Eve, the maiden combines the naivety of the child with the sexuality of the seductress, the mother combines the liveliness of the child with the maturity of the wife, and the crone maps most closely to the wise, levelheaded wife. However, the sexuality of the Hecate Sisters is very likely mutable \u2014 if the Maiden is a young girl, then the mother might take on the role of an experienced and sensual woman, who happens to be maternal as well.\nIf, as is often the case, the three are witches, the maiden (and sometimes the mother) will usually be a Hot Witch, while the crone almost always conforms to at least the visual stereotype of the Wicked Witch.\nAge wise, compare the Three Successful Generations. Also compare The Three Faces of Adam and Same-Sex Triplets.\n\nExamples" }

A rape victim may avoid the malicious gossip (or perhaps Honor-Related Abuse) and hide in all-female world. After a Heel-Face Turn, this may show repentence. Some do not actually take vows, but none of them intend to return to the world.\nThis is usually a Ending Trope, and a Bittersweet Ending at that, because she usually is escaping tragedy to the only refuge she has. It may also be a way to dispose of minor characters without much ado.\nIn the middle of the story, a character may attempt this, but this usually leads to the abbess rebuking her gently and sending her back into the world on the grounds she has no vocation.\nImmured\nA woman's father ruthlessly compels her to enter the convent to shut her off from her lover, because he thinks she has disgraced the family, or just to save her dowry. (The permanant form of Locked Away in a Monastery.)\nOr a woman who promised I Will Wait for You foolishly gave up hope, and her lover returns to find she entered a convent. Horrors! This differs from Retiring to A Convent in that her decision was foolish even if a desperate attempt to escape an Arranged Marriage, and her being bound by her vows is treated as a dreadful thing. Unsurprisingly this particular trope was chiefly Protestant, and was a Discredited Trope by the end of the Victorian era.\nVocation\nUsually found only in explicitly religious literature. A woman wants to become a nun when her family considers it her duty to submit to an Arranged Marriage. She is often \u2014 especially when the story is far removed from Real Life \u2014 So Beautiful, It's a Curse, because they think they can get a good match because of it.\nA Real Life vocation is a spiritual prompting, like becoming a priest or minister after feeling \"called\" by God. But a woman who merely wants to become a nun and does seldom appears in stories while she is doing it, because that part of her story lacks drama.\nMen can fall under any of these reason as well, although their greater ability to control their own lives and lesser need for a refuge have meant it's a predominately female trope.\nThese tropes can apply to either Buddhist or Christian nuns \u2014 and were used in some Crystal Dragon Jesus pagan situations. Note that it applies only to nuns, and monks, whose taking vows was a significant event in either the story itself or its Back Story. Has nothing to do with Get Thee to a Nunnery." }

However, the implication is that, while a \"femme\" would be attracted to a \"butch\", lipstick lesbians are attracted to others of the same type.

The reasons for this proportional over-representation can include Fanservice (because Girl on Girl Is Hot), wanting to avert the stereotype of Butch Lesbian (and the Unfortunate Implications that non-heterosexuals are \"gender inverted\"), wanting to present a lesbian character that won't \"intimidate\" viewers, and also wanting to avoid making said lesbian character's sexuality an excessively large issue by presenting her as a person who just happens to be attracted to other women.\nRelated to the opposite of Butch Lesbian, a high femme.

The viewers have been Ship Teased; and now that the writers got their attention, they can write more comfortable (to them) relationships. The lesbian subtext may not even last beyond the opening credits.\nThe is pretty common in Bishoujo fandom, where the Romantic Two-Girl Friendship develops for a number of unintentional factors. One could say that audience likes girls in large quantities, and seeing two girls acting cute, even at each other, is better than one. One could also point out that far more attention is put into the interaction and communication between the girls; while a relationship with a guy just \"happens\" with most development offscreen. And if they're the only people you see but the show still maintains particular tropes, the audience is sometimes led toward an imagined payoff that might not be there. Often, this is coupled with a young age for both characters as well as the lack of any actual 'sexuality' in either character, barring concessions, as this outcome is harder to rationalize for an adult character. Note that any romantic relationship with boys, on the other hand, is considered completely serious at any age. Yes, it's hypocritical.\nTends to raise the hackles of a show's Yuri Fandom, who tend to crop up more infrequently, but also makes them paranoid in the long run. Any male friend of one of the girls becomes the Sword of Damocles; a possible route of escape for the writers via Last Minute Hookup. So expect malevolence. It takes frustratingly little for a male character to become a love interest. A single scene, or a \"Where Are They Now?\" Epilogue, can instantly make canon overturn entire seasons of meaningful interaction between female characters.\nAn ironic result of this is making a relationship explicit can result in enough fuel for viewers who oppose the shipping to simply scoff that any evidence of the pairing is \"just fanservice.\" The fact that a great many shows avoid portraying relationships in significant detail muddies it further: so many other shows cop out at the last minute, so why should this one be different? The writers won't ever admit anything anyways.\nOutside of canon this trope is invoked a lot especially in H-doujins due to a rather persistent tendency for male writers to be intimidated by the idea of girls who don't find them sexually attractive (though generally only mildly). This is the reason why a disturbingly large number of popular lesbian characters and characters who are popular in part because of their near lesbian tendencies are depicted in huge amounts of heterosexual porn with a random male insert or more and very frequently in the form of rape instead of with each other. Think of it somewhat as the Distaff Counterpart to All the Good Men Are Gay except this time, you can get them back on the \"home team\" so to speak.\nThis trope is also occasionally applied to male characters, usually in order to appeal to Yaoi Fangirls and an LGBT Fanbase without alienating straight viewers, in which case it's usually known as queerbaiting. Queerbaiting is usually considered quite homophobic, patronising and cynical when it's done these days, but in the past was often the only way queer creators could make media featuring characters like themselves due to the values of the time. In these cases the Slash Fic fanbase often shows up to make the Subtext text.\nCompare Faux Yay. Related to the Sweeps Week Lesbian Kiss." }

She holds important various roles for the cohesion of the club: cleaning and buying equipment, preparing energy food, keeping tabs on the players' data, and providing moral support to said players.\nUsually a pretty and good-hearted girl, she's loved and respected by the club's members. She may be seconded by one or two female assistants (more often than not her underclassmen) who act as her Lancer(s), or as either her girly girl or her tomboy, depending on the girl's own personality traits.\nThere are two common variations of this character:\n1) She's the official team manager who is actually part of the school system. There, the Cute Sports Club Manager has a good chance of becoming an Official Couple with the story's club player main protagonist, even more so if he's the team's captain, such as the Kendo Team Captain. Her assistant(s) and the other club players will then usually go Shipper on Deck for the two.\n2) She's the coach's daughter, acting as the unofficial manager of the team. This variation tends to have her be a Tomboy and a sports nut, and either too young to be a viable love interest, or off limits because the coach would kill you (though this has the possibility of romance drama too).\nIt's not rare for both variations of this character to, at a point, make lucky charms such as hachimaki or misangas for every member of the team. The one she'll design specifically for her love interest will usually have an extra feature or be better made than the others.\nA Stock Character in High School sports-themed manga, anime and Dating Sims (usually seen in works of The Eighties and Nineties).\nIn the West, this fits as a Discredited Trope.

While their male counterparts are usually either dumb or jerks, fictional female athletes are usually given sympathetic portrayals and more often are used to explore gender roles.\nUsually this just means that girls who like to play sports (particularly traditional male sports) are Tomboys who prefers to play with the boys. Often she can put the Jerk Jock in his place by beating him at his own sport. Of course she can vary anywhere from a girl who's sweet and shy but puts her all into the game to one who has a dark personality and just wants to play football.\nYou can tell that she's passionate because this girl lives for one sport at which she excels, or perhaps for any opportunity to show her strength, despite what anyone else thinks. In the first case, if it's a traditionally male sport, her desire to prove herself could lead to Sweet Polly Oliver as she attempts to get on an all boy team. If she plays a variety of sports then she's more likely to be the Girl Next Door. If it's a boys' team then it's You Go Girl.\nShe's also a more accessible Love Interest for the hero, since he can get to know her better by playing sports with her. There is a bit of Wish Fulfillment here for both the guys (who want a girlfriend they can talk sports with) and the girls (who want to associate themselves easier with sporty guys). On the other hand, making sports her priority can be intimidating, at least at first.\nIn works focused on female characters she is sometimes subjected to Even the Girls Want Her since her sports heroics impresses the girls, but without being as intimidating as a boy. This is particularly common in Anime. When taken to the logical extreme this can turn her into a Lesbian Jock.\nUnlike male athletes who are usually not depicted as stellar at academics, female athletes are more likely to be an Academic Athlete who has excellent grades as well. Though this isn't always the case.\nCompare Gamer Girl, another example of a female in a traditionally male-dominated medium, and also the Girly Bruiser, who can have the same passion for sports but have a Girly Girl personality.

Right there, you know she's a badass because she must be so good at her job, that even any discrimination which might have been in her way due to either her femininity or her minority status was bulldozed flat in two-point-five seconds by her incredible competency.\nBecause the Black Boss Lady is good, or she wouldn't be where she is today. She's not afraid to take some risk if there is a decent chance of a worthwhile pay off. She presides over her organization with an iron fist, but she's also a Reasonable Authority Figure, and will give the Cowboy Cop (or lawyer, or reporter, etc.) credit where it's due. At first she might seem like a hardass by-the-book type but inevitably they get used to each other, she reveals hidden depths, and the two give each other room to work and come to appreciate the other's strength.\nWhen it comes to drama, her blackness is hardly ever mentioned, her femaleness being the main source of plot. This being so she won't have much of an Urban Accent or have many tropes stereotypically associated with blackness. She almost never slips into Sassy Black Woman, for instance. She's also usually very well-dressed, in a business skirt-suit or slacks (nothing even remotely risque), and it's not uncommon for her clothes to be somewhat masculine.

She ignores nudity taboos by choice and couldn't care less who's disturbed by it.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean she prances around the streets in the nude 24/7. Perhaps she's just the type who sleeps in the nude, spends all of her private time in her house without clothing, or only goes nude when she feels safe doing so, such as at the beach. But whatever the reasoning and specifics, the key factor is that she does understand that nudity is typically frowned upon by people.\nHer amount of consideration to people who are uncomfortable around her nudity can vary. Sometimes she will get dressed just for the sake of her house guests. Other times she'll have a \"screw you\" attitude and not let the disturbed countenance of her house guests persuade her to stop being naked if she wants to be. It pretty much depends on what kind of person she is.\nSatirical or comedic versions frequently have her facing no repercussions at all (much like her innocent sister-trope), or only comedic ones. Sometimes, for extra comedic effect, her nudity will only be noticed by one person whilst being ignored by everyone else for no apparent reason. More serious portrayals will tend towards the discreet: Characters that reject the taboo but otherwise do not make it an issue, or only in semi-private situations where they are within their rights to decide what to wear.\nWhile this trope can overlap with Attention Whores, it is not a subtrope. This is not \"the exhibitionism trope\", but rather, \"the knowingly unashamed trope\". This does not preclude a rare Attention Whore who is also a Shameless Fanservice Girl, but it is not a requirement. The polar opposite of Reluctant Fanservice Girl.\n\nExamples" }

The Unrequited Tragic Maiden is (usually) a female character that seems to have all the perfect characteristics to make her the ideal romantic interest or even The Ingenue of the story, but alas, for some reason the object of her affections does not view her as such. Usually this is because she is overshadowed by another female character who has captivated the heart of the guy, placing the Unrequited Tragic Maiden on the sideline only to be seen as a friend or ward.\nNo matter how painful her yearning for love is, the Unrequited Tragic Maiden never truly achieves her happily ever after with the one she loves. She endures it all with a sad smile and is often reduced to a tragic fate. She is the poster child of Unrequited Love. In the end she will often sacrifice herself or her happiness to make sure her beloved is happy.\nFan reactions to her tend to be mixed. Many fans will cheer and push for the Maiden's success, to the extent of calling The Hero an Ungrateful Bastard if he doesn't fall to the girl's feet (because the often never asked for pining and sacrifices are seen by fans as him owing her affection or sex no matter what he actually thinks or says) or Slut Shaming any possible female love rival (because The Hero is seen as a tool of women's validation and some think that women shouldn't act on their own romantic feelings if it interferes with others); and if the Maiden doesn't succeed, much bashing of the author shall be expected. On the other hand, others will turn against the Maiden and call her insulting names; this is especially obvious if either The Hero has another prospect love interest or female friend who's perceived as being \"stronger\" and \"cooler\" than the maiden herself, or the Maiden has a second prospect male love interest whose (canon or not) feelings she passes up on to favor The Hero.\n(It should also be pointed out that, specially in modern times, several of these Maidens are also full-blooded characters with motivations, relationships, backstories and/or interests that go beyond their Unrequited Loves... and yet many fans will insist on only focusing on their love woes, either ignoring or refusing to see their non-romantic character depths.)\nCompare to Hopeless Suitor and Romantic Runner-Up, who is the brother of this trope but usually with a less tragic end.

Contrast to Green-Eyed Monster, in which the woman is more prone to sabotage and a devious nature unlike the docile nature of the Unrequited Tragic Maiden.\nThis is starting to become either a Discredited Trope as romantic portrayals of females become less dependent on the male characters, or a Deconstructed Trope to showcase a point-of-view of it being an unrealistic idea of romantic love." }

It is in fact one of the most popular heroines or love interests in Visual Novels, branching out from there into anime, perhaps surpassed only by the ever-present tsundere and childhood friend. Like the similarly ubiquitous Childhood Friend Romance, it is extremely prone to lampshade hangings.\nAs a Love Interest trope based on the little sister/older brother dynamic, the story will usually dwell on the romantic tension a fair amount, though as always the brother may be completely oblivious. Despite the name, Little Sister Heroine attempts to mitigate the obvious incestuous fallout; They\u2019re usually either a step sister, adopted or, somewhat more rarely, technically a cousin or other more distant relation. In almost all cases, the younger sister is going to be either some degree of tsundere, childish and clingy or simply highly devoted to their older brother. Finally, the relationship between the two will likely be noticed or exaggerated by the rest of the cast.

She might even tell The Hero that she doesn't need his help, even though, unlike the Damsel, she often has children dependent on her and therefore also in danger. Usually a young widow if she is in distress, as older widows are more likely to be depicted as competent enough not to need saving.\nThe Hero (or The Protagonist) protects the widow from a dastardly villain attempting to take advantage of her (either romantically, or simply stealing from her because she has no man to protect her). Sometimes the villains were the ones who killed her husband, and so the goal is to avenge her husband. This is particularly common in The Western, especially when the hero is The Drifter.\nOften the Hero ends up getting to marry the widow at the end, and this can be a reason for The Drifter to finally settle down. In fact, widow Love Interests have a better chance at getting to keep The Drifter than other Love Interests, who tend to win his love, \"But Now I Must Go\" because he wants his beloved to be happy.\nOlder Determined Widows are more likely to appear as advisers to the Heroes.\nDetermined Widows also often insist on achieving their dead husband's dream. If their husband was a warrior and he fell in battle they might even \"take up his sword\" and become an Action Girl or Lady of War and continue his fight.\nCompare House Wife and Determined Homesteader's Wife, which is what they were likely to be before being widowed. Her Heart Will Go On for the widow's strength in dealing with the loss. Do NOT confuse with Yamato Nadeshiko which is an aspect of Japanese culture; while they can overlap, all they have in common is the inner core of iron will. Does not necessarily have anything to do with another type of widow." }

Often she is the younger wife of a deceased faculty member or college president, but in any case she is barely older than the students she courts. As a genuine widow, she came upon a healthy taste (and talent) for sexual relations legitimately, but her youth left her with her wifely desires still burning hot; she thus turns to the school's handy supply of strapping young men to fill them. Her house, just off the campus, is usually the home to at least one Wild Teen Party a week if not more, and during Prohibition it's all but a speakeasy.\nIn an era when most colleges and universities were male-only, she was usually the only outlet for a healthy young man's sexual urges short of the nearest brothel, and often far less expensive. Naturally, other local citizens viewed her as being a singlehanded danger to the moral rectitude of hundreds if not thousands of impressionable young men. Usually seen as a Femme Fatale if not The Vamp, although she normally serves no master but her own libido.\nA Forgotten Trope since at least the 1960s, if not decades earlier.

Not to mention that it gives the harpist a definite air of dignity and nobility. As such, harp-playing women in fiction are almost always important to the plot.\nThis trope is Older Than Radio but not Older Than Steam, and doesn't generally come in to play much in works from before the French Revolution. As such the Wandering Minstrel (a medieval trope) will often be male and play the harp, and playing the lyre also Gender Flips this trope just as often as not (most of the 'inversions' listed below concern hand-held harps and lyres, rather than the sort of grand harp one would see in an orchestra). In the very, very rare occurrences where a man is shown playing the harp, he will be at least a particularly effeminate Bishōnen.\nIn ancient Western culture, the harp was if anything a masculine instrument.

She may have some sort of twisted motive (actually depending on the society that person lives in it might be an entirely reasonable and sensible choice) for conceiving her child, such as providing an heir for a powerful male relative or to train to be the perfect killer. Basically, when you combine Exotic Dragon Lady and Stalker with a Test Tube, you get Asian Babymama. Unfortunate Implications may follow.\nThis trope largely has its roots in American service men bringing home wives from U.S. wars in Asia. At the time there was a stigma to the servicemen there knocking up hookers and marrying Asian women that were pretty much seen as call girls. In other cases, said service men got the women pregnant and then rotated home, leaving said women and their children to face social stigma, especially once Vietnam was unified.\nAs those wars are less contemporary now and that stereotype is dying, this trope is becoming less common.

It is a very popular element of Grimmified works. To increase the association with the fairy tale, the red garment is often a coat, a cape, or something with a hood.\nRed is, of course, the colour of blood, and as such it carries ancient associations with sexuality (as in Lady in Red) and danger (as in Red Shirt). It is also simply a very strong, eye-catching colour. Anyone wearing head-to-toe red is marked out, highly visible and memorable - not only to the audience but also to anyone who may wish to harm her. When that person is a little girl, she is bound to seem especially exposed and vulnerable.\nThis is Older Than Steam, considering that some of the older endings for Little Red Riding Hood really do end with the wolf killing and eating her, notably the 1697 Charles Perrault telling that predates the more popular (and less grim) Grimm Brothers version. (Ironically, another early version of the story where the protagonist survives was one written in 1890 by Andrew Lang called \"The True History of Little Goldenhood\". As the name suggests, she does not wear red at all, and what makes it ironic is, she is saved by the golden hood itself, which is enchanted.

She gets her kicks from kicking patients, the weaker the better. If she isn't already the head nurse, her cruelty gives her a degree of power over both the patients and the other nurses. Anybody who goes against her ends up injured or worse, and she jumps at the chance to give a particularly rebellious patient a lobotomy. Sometimes the Battleaxe Nurse has a hint of the Mad Doctor in her, especially if she decides to test interesting new drugs on her helpless patients.\nIn terms of her origins, the Battleaxe Nurse has many. First is the Subversion of what the audience expects - nurses are supposed to be caring right? This type of subversion is similar in its origins to the Evil Clown trope - clowns are supposed to be associated with joy, and thus it creates a rich irony to associate them with terror. Likewise for the Battleaxe Nurse.\nAnother origin is by subverting the Hospital Hottie trope - rather than conform to male fantasy, the Battleaxe Nurse crushes it.\nOn a deeper level, the concept of a sadist nurse explores a very real fear that many patients have going into hospital. It is, sadly, Truth In Tropes that some of the most vulnerable people are badly treated while they are weakened and in the care of strangers. By creating characters in media that express this fear, negative emotions can be explored from a safe distance.\nThe most famous example of this trope, if not the Trope Maker, is Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.\nThere's also a milder version more common in comedy. This version is still hugely unsympathetic and enjoys having power over the patients and other nurses, but can still say with some justification that everything she's doing is for the patients' own good (although the patients are unlikely to see it like that). In British works, she almost certainly has the title Matron and is played by Hattie Jacques (who actually was a Red Cross nurse during W.W.II). This type of Matron figure was also popular in older Australian series.\nA subtrope is the Triage Tyrant." }

Much more common is the case where a weak-willed political leader will reveal secrets to an ordinary prostitute who will then reveal it to the press or others, fulfilling the trope retroactively. That said, the biological basis for this trope is quite sound: orgasm tends to shut off the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for, among other things, controlling behavior and impulses, and even simple kissing releases oxytocin, which is known to make people more trusting. Lack of self-control + misplaced trust = Loose Lips.\nFinally, one doesn't need to actually get the target to reveal secrets directly; photographs or other embarrassing evidence of the encounter can be used to blackmail the target into giving you what you want (the classic Honey Trap).\nSee also Gentleman Thief, Classy Cat-Burglar, Honey Trap, Femme Fatale, The Vamp and Spy Catsuit.\nFor the Mata Hari Pinball by Bally, click here." }

She is usually extremely childish, such that even her own students appear more mature than her.\nIf the story's emphasis is on the female students, she will act like one of the girls, a teenager in spirit. In Harem Series with a male protagonists, she is more likely to be a bit Hot for Student, as a comical side-character of the harem. A common character flaw Played for Laughs is drinking enthusiastically.\nTheir frequent complaints about being unable to settle down in a proper relationship, are probably based on the traditional Japanese culture's conflicting expectations, that a married woman shouldn't work, and a woman over 25 should be married, and for the intended audience of Anime, schoolteachers provided the first, childhood exposure to women with this dilemma, enforcing the stereotype that teachers are the sort of women who can never get married.\nThe trope's name is a combination of two honorifics, \"-sensei\" is used for teachers, like \"Miss\", and \"-chan\" is an informal affectionate diminutive. While the combined usage is grammatically correct, and it reflects the characters in spirit, it's unlikely that anyone would use it for a Real Life teacher either in this form, or as \"-chan-sensei\", since it would be about as conflicting and disrespectful as \"Miss-baby\", or \"Teacher chick\" in English.\nOn the other end, they tend to be on First Name Basis by their students, which is incredibly rare in real life. \"-sensei\", like its western equivalents, is normally associated to the last name, but these characters may as well not have one.\nThis trope can also overlap with Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher or Hippie Teacher. May preside over a Wacky Homeroom.\n\nExamples" }

Usually, this trope either takes the form of lesbian characters playing sports, or other people assuming (correctly or incorrectly) that a female character is a lesbian because she enjoys sports. There seems to be a sliding scale of which sports are acceptable for girls without questioning their femininity and which are not. Performance-based sports like gymnastics, figure skating, diving, and cheerleading are all \"okay\"; most competitive sports like softball, volleyball, track, soccer, tennis, and basketball are 50/50; but \"masculine\" sports like wrestling, American football, rugby and, strangely enough, golf are almost a sure bet. One common subtrope is the Butch Lesbian P.E. teacher.\nHer rough Spear Counterpart could be considered the Gym Bunny. However, the lesbian jock is usually into sports because she's a tomboy while the Gym Bunny is usually into physical fitness because he's a narcissist. The counterpart of this trope is Lipstick Lesbian.\nFrom this standpoint, the Spear Counterpart would be Performance Artist, where certain performance arts are 'reserved' for women and that any man who choose to partake in them are automatically more 'feminine' (and thus in turn inclined to homosexuality) than those who don't. The same logical fallacy applies.\nA variant, with many of the same stereotypes, is the Lesbian Cop." }

As luck will have it, however, the Smurfette will end up being accused of just being catty because the new friend is a girl.\nIn stories where Status Quo Is God, you'll see the Smurfette turn out to be right because the new girl was either the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing or a Sixth Ranger Traitor, typically with only Smurfette to see through the act. In stories where there can be legitimate progress, the new girl will just be a target of shallow jealousy because the new girl is markedly more feminine or able to get along with the men more easily. In the end, the two women may end up becoming friends. Sometimes these two courses for the story get combined, leading to more interesting results.\nA subtrope of The Smurfette Principle.

She's unfailingly polite to her peers, older adults, and younger children alike. She might not be a fashion plate, but she never steps outside her home without looking perfectly presentable. Nobody doubts that big things are to be expected of her.\nThey are, right? Otherwise, it would be so frustrating for all that effort to go to waste!\nThe Go-Getter Girl is a young woman who devotes herself to achievements other than homemaking above everything else. The reasons for this might vary: she may have some personal goal she feels she needs to accomplish, she may be desperately seeking the approval of others, or she may simply enjoy competing against her peers and taking the number one rank. In any case, she's well aware of the effort that her path requires, but she's more than up to the challenge. She finds it easy, or at least manageable, to discipline herself to avoid distractions, and while others might complain about the expectations of superiors, she will do whatever she can to meet and exceed them.\nDespite all appearences, things aren't always as easy for the Go-Getter Girl as they may seem. All the discipline that goes into creating her persona of perfection may crowd out the possibility for sponteneity, fun, and other pleasures of youth. It's not that she doesn't want these things deep down; it's just that she feels that she doesn't have the luxury of acting on them. For this reason, while she might always seem completely put-together in public, in the few moments she has to herself in private, she's liable to let herself go and act like a slob and a slacker...or at least fantasize about doing so. At extremes, the pressure of maintaining her image can get to her, causing her to snap and turn evil or insane.\nThat being said, Tropes Are Not Bad. Although the Go-Getter Girl must deal with a certain amount of pressure, her personality also allows her to accomplish things others of her peers cannot. If she is able to find balance in her life, she has the potential to become a true leader.\nRomance is often a secondary concern in such a character's life; she's more focused on her future for the time being. If her mind does turn to love, she's liable to look for someone of a status befitting her own perceived value. In the case where she is secretly attracted to someone she sees as beneath her, expect a lot of furious denials and put-downs as she (generally unsuccessfully) tries to distance herself from her feelings.\nIf the Go-Getter Girl is in high school, she is very often a Class Representative or Student Council President, as well as focused on entering the Ivy League, Oxbridge, or Tokyo University. College Go-Getter Girls will be racking up internships and academic distinctions as they position themselves for an appealing job when they graduate. The oldest a Go-Getter Girl is likely to be is her late 20s or early 30s; by this time, if they have continued to stay on the path to success, they will have begun to take on real responsibilities and grown into a different trope.\nGo-Getter Boys can exist, but they are much rarer. This may be due to the historical legacies of sexism, as discrimination has forced women to prove themselves in order to get the same rewards as men. For this reason, a boy with academic talents or personal charisma is more likely to focus on developing those traits alone, without the need to appear perfect in other areas.\nCompare and contrast with Plucky Girl, a similarly strong and determined character type, but one that shows more comfort with breaking rules and flouting social conventions, as well as The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, who has these pressures thrust upon her as a member of royalty rather than freely choosing them.\nCompare and contrast also with Academic Alpha Bitch. Also not to be confused with female characters who work with Getter Rays.\nExamples:" }

They don't get very much access to sensitive areas of the castle, it is true, but chances are someone will notice our heroine's talents and give her a promotion, or else that she'll have a knack for attracting Exact Eavesdropping. If the infiltration has some sort of assassination in mind, kitchen staff have a perfect opportunity to poison people. If there's a ball, promotions can go quite high.

Contrast with Meido, French Maid, and Ninja Maid for less realistic interpretations of the role. For reference, the scullery is a small, hot, sweaty room behind the kitchen, where heavy, dirty, menial work, such as cleaning pots and pans, is carried out.\nThe Spear Counterpart is also found, particularly in works more carefully based on the High Middle Ages or earlier.

This character tends to have a Mysterious Past and hinted-at childhood trauma. She might be sexually repressed or traumatized too. Whatever her problems, there's always the subtle suggestion that she herself might be imagining the whole thing because of her messed-up psyche. Freud would have loved the Haunted Heroine.
